            <p>I</p>
            
            
            <p>I am forced into speech because men of science have refused to follow my advice without
               knowing why. It is altogether against my will that I tell my reasons for opposing
               this contemplated invasion of the

            </p>
            
            
            <p>Doubt of the real facts, as I must reveal them, is inevitable; yet, if I suppressed
               what will seem extravagant and incredible, there would be nothing left. The hitherto
               withheld photographs, both ordinary and aerial, will count in my favor, for they are
               damnably vivid and graphic. Still, they will be doubted because of the great lengths
               to which clever fakery can be carried. The ink drawings, of course, will be jeered
               at as obvious impostures, notwithstanding a strangeness of technique which art experts
               ought to remark and puzzle over.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>In the end I must rely on the judgment and standing of the few scientific leaders
               who have, on the one hand, sufficient independence of thought to weigh my data on
               its own hideously convincing merits or in the light of certain

               in general from any rash and over-ambitious program in the region of those mountains
               of madness. It is an unfortunate fact that relatively obscure men like myself and
               my associates, connected only with a small university, have little chance of making
               an impression where matters of a wildly

            <p>It is further against us that we are not, in the strictest sense, specialists in the
               fields which came primarily to be concerned. As a geologist, my object in leading
               the 
               Miskatonic University Expedition was wholly that of securing deep-level specimens of rock and soil from various parts
               of the 
               <mark class="scientific" title="2">antarctic</mark><span class="note"><strong>Synset('antarctic.n.01'): </strong>the region around the south pole: Antarctica and surrounding waters<br /><strong>Synset('south-polar.s.01'): </strong>at or near the south pole<br /></span> continent, aided by the remarkable drill devised by Professor Frank H. Pabodie of our engineering department. I had no wish to be a pioneer in any other field than
               this, but I did hope that the use of this new mechanical appliance at different points
               along previously explored paths would bring to light materials of a sort hitherto
               unreached by the ordinary methods of collection.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>
               Pabodie's drilling apparatus, as the public already knows from our reports, was unique and
               radical in its lightness, portability, and capacity to combine the ordinary artesian
               drill principle with the principle of the small circular rock drill in such a way
               as to cope quickly with strata of varying hardness. Steel head, jointed rods, gasoline
               motor, collapsible wooden derrick, dynamiting paraphernalia, cording, rubbish-removal
               auger, and sectional piping for bores five inches wide and up to one thousand feet
               deep all formed, with needed accessories, no greater load than three seven-dog sledges
               could carry. This was made possible by the clever aluminum alloy of which most of
               the metal objects were fashioned. Four large Dornier aeroplanes, designed especially
               for the tremendous altitude flying necessary on the 
               <mark class="scientific" title="2">antarctic</mark><span class="note"><strong>Synset('antarctic.n.01'): </strong>the region around the south pole: Antarctica and surrounding waters<br /><strong>Synset('south-polar.s.01'): </strong>at or near the south pole<br /></span> plateau and with added fuel-warming and quick-starting devices worked out by Pabodie, could transport our entire expedition from a base at the edge of the great ice barrier
               to various suitable inland points, and from these points a sufficient quota of dogs
               would serve us.

               mountain ranges and on the plateau south of 
               Ross Sea; regions explored in varying degree by Shackleton, Amundsen, Scott, and Byrd. With frequent changes of camp, made by aeroplane and involving distances great enough
               to be of geological significance, we expected to

               our knowledge of the earth's past. That the

               life of which the lichens, marine fauna, arachnida, and penguins of the northern edge
               are the only survivals, is a matter of common information; and we hoped to expand
               that information in variety, accuracy, and detail. When a simple boring revealed 
               <mark class="scientific" title="1">fossiliferous</mark><span class="note"><strong>Synset('fossiliferous.a.01'): </strong>bearing or containing fossils<br /></span> signs, we would enlarge the aperture by blasting, in order to get specimens of suitable
               size and condition.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>Our borings, of varying depth according to the promise held out by the upper soil
               or rock, were to be confined to exposed, or nearly exposed, land surfaces--these inevitably
               being slopes and ridges because of the mile or two-mile thickness of solid ice overlying
               the lower levels. We could not afford to waste drilling the depth of any considerable
               amount of mere glaciation, though Pabodie had worked out a plan for sinking copper electrodes in thick clusters of borings
               and melting off limited areas of ice with current from a gasoline-driven dynamo. It
               is this plan--which we could not put into effect except experimentally on an expedition
               such as ours--that the coming Starkweather-Moore Expedition proposes to follow, despite the warnings I have issued since our return from the

            </p>
            
            
            <p>The public knows of the Miskatonic Expedition through our frequent wireless reports to the Arkham Advertiser and Associated Press, and through the later articles of Pabodie and myself. We consisted of four men from the University--Pabodie, Lake of the biology department, Atwood of the physics department--also a meteorologist--and myself, representing geology
               and having nominal command--besides sixteen assistants: seven graduate students from
               Miskatonic and nine skilled mechanics. Of these sixteen, twelve were qualified aeroplane pilots,
               all but two of whom were competent wireless operators. Eight of them understood navigation
               with compass and sextant, as did Pabodie, Atwood, and I. In addition, of course, our two ships--wooden ex-whalers, reinforced for
               ice conditions and having auxiliary steam--were fully manned.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>The Nathaniel Derby Pickman Foundation, aided by a few special contributions, financed the expedition; hence our preparations
               were extremely thorough, despite the absence of great publicity. The dogs, sledges,
               machines, camp materials, and unassembled parts of our five planes were delivered
               in Boston, and there our ships were loaded. We were marvelously well-equipped for
               our specific purposes, and in all matters pertaining to supplies, regimen, transportation,
               and camp construction we profited by the excellent example of our many recent and
               exceptionally brilliant predecessors. It was the unusual number and fame of these
               predecessors which made our own expedition--ample though it was--so little noticed
               by the world at large.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>As the newspapers told, we sailed from Boston Harbor on September 2nd, 1930, taking a leisurely course down the coast and through the Panama Canal, and stopping at Samoa and Hobart, Tasmania, at which latter place we took on final supplies. None of our exploring party had
               ever been in the polar regions before, hence we all relied greatly on our ship captains--J. B. Douglas, commanding the brig Arkham, and serving as commander of the sea party, and Georg Thorfinnssen, commanding the barque Miskatonic--both veteran whalers in 
               <mark class="scientific" title="2">antarctic</mark><span class="note"><strong>Synset('antarctic.n.01'): </strong>the region around the south pole: Antarctica and surrounding waters<br /><strong>Synset('south-polar.s.01'): </strong>at or near the south pole<br /></span> waters.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>As we left the inhabited world behind, the sun sank lower and lower in the north,
               and stayed longer and longer above the horizon each day. At about 62Â° South Latitude we sighted our first icebergs--table-like objects with vertical sides--and just before
               reaching the 
               <mark class="scientific" title="2">antarctic</mark><span class="note"><strong>Synset('antarctic.n.01'): </strong>the region around the south pole: Antarctica and surrounding waters<br /><strong>Synset('south-polar.s.01'): </strong>at or near the south pole<br /></span> circle, which we crossed on October 20th with appropriately quaint ceremonies, we were considerably troubled with field ice.
               The falling temperature bothered me considerably after our long voyage through the
               tropics, but I tried to brace up for the worse rigors to come. On many occasions the
               curious atmospheric effects enchanted me vastly; these including a strikingly vivid
               mirage--the first I had ever seen--in which distant bergs became the battlements of
               unimaginable cosmic castles.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>Pushing through the ice, which was fortunately neither extensive nor thickly packed,
               we regained open water at South Latitude 77Â° 9'.
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p>The last lap of the voyage was vivid and fancy-stirring. Great barren peaks of

               the desolate summits swept ranging, intermittent gusts of the terrible

               musical piping, with notes extending over a wide range, and which for some subconscious
               mnemonic reason seemed to me disquieting and even dimly terrible. Something about
               the scene reminded me of the strange and disturbing Asian paintings of Nicholas Roerich
               , and of the still stranger and more disturbing descriptions of the

            <p>On the 7th of November, sight of the westward range having been temporarily lost, we passed Franklin Island; and the next day descried the cones of Mts. Erebus and Terror on Ross Island ahead, with the long line of the Parry Mountains beyond. There now stretched off to the east the low, white line of the great ice
               barrier, rising perpendicularly to a height of two hundred feet like the rocky cliffs
               of Quebec, and marking the end of southward navigation. In the afternoon we entered McMurdo Sound and stood off the coast in the lee of smoking Mt. Erebus. The scoriac peak towered up some twelve thousand, seven hundred feet against the
               eastern sky, like a Japanese print of the

            <p>Puffs of smoke from Erebus came intermittently, and one of the graduate assistants--a brilliant young fellow
               named Danforth--pointed out what looked like lava on the snowy slope, remarking that this mountain,
               discovered in 1840, had undoubtedly been the source of 
               Poe's image when he wrote seven years later:

            <p>Using small boats, we effected a difficult landing on Ross Island shortly after midnight on the morning of the 9th, carrying a line of cable from each of the ships and preparing to unload supplies
               by means of a breeches-buoy arrangement. Our sensations on first treading Antarctic soil were poignant and complex, even though at this particular point the 
               Scott and Shackleton expeditions had preceded us. Our camp on the frozen shore below the volcano's slope was only
               a provisional one, headquarters being kept aboard the Arkham. We landed all our drilling
               apparatus, dogs, sledges, tents, provisions, gasoline tanks, experimental ice-melting
               outfit, cameras, both ordinary and aerial, aeroplane parts, and other accessories,
               including three small portable wireless outfits--besides those in the planes--capable
               of communicating with the Arkham's large outfit from any part of the

               Miskatonic north before the freezing of the ice for another summer's supplies.

            <p>I need not repeat what the newspapers have already published about our early work:
               of our ascent of Mt. Erebus; our successful mineral borings at several points on Ross Island and the singular speed with which Pabodie's apparatus accomplished them, even through solid rock layers; our provisional test
               of the small ice-melting equipment; our perilous ascent of the great barrier with
               sledges and supplies; and our final assembling of five huge aeroplanes at the camp
               atop the barrier. The health of our land party--twenty men and fifty-five Alaskan sledge dogs--was remarkable, though of course we had so far encountered no really
               destructive temperatures or windstorms. For the most part, the thermometer varied
               between zero and 20Â° or 25Â° above, and our experience with New England winters had accustomed us to rigors of this sort. The barrier camp was semi-permanent,
               and destined to be a storage cache for gasoline, provisions, dynamite, and other supplies.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>Only four of our planes were needed to carry the actual exploring material, the fifth
               being left with a pilot and two men from the ships at the storage cache to form a
               means of reaching us from the Arkham in case all our exploring planes were lost. Later,
               when not using all the other planes for moving apparatus, we would employ one or two
               in a shuttle transportation service between this cache and another permanent base
               on the great plateau from six hundred to seven hundred miles southward, beyond Beardmore Glacier. Despite the almost unanimous accounts of appalling winds and tempests that pour
               down from the plateau, we determined to dispense with intermediate bases, taking our
               chances in the interest of economy and probable efficiency.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>Wireless reports have spoken of the breathtaking, four-hour, nonstop flight of our
               squadron on November 21st over the lofty shelf ice, with vast peaks rising on the
               west, and the unfathomed silences echoing to the sound of our engines. Wind troubled
               us only moderately, and our radio compasses helped us through the one opaque fog we
               encountered. When the vast rise loomed ahead, between  and 84Â°, we knew we had reached Beardmore Glacier, the largest valley glacier in the world, and that the frozen sea was now giving
               place to a frowning and mountainous coast line. At last we were truly entering the
               white, 
               <mark class="other" title="0">aeon-dead</mark><span class="note"></span> world of the ultimate south. Even as we realized it we saw the peak of Mt. Nansen in the eastern distance, towering up to its height of almost fifteen thousand feet.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>The successful establishment of the southern base above the glacier in East Longitude 174Â° 23', and the phenomenally rapid and effective borings and blastings made at various points
               reached by our sledge trips and short aeroplane flights, are matters of history; as
               is the arduous and triumphant ascent of Mt. Nansen by Pabodie and two of the graduate students--Gedney and Carroll--on December 13-15. We were some eight thousand, five hundred feet above sea-level, and when experimental
               drillings revealed solid ground only twelve feet down through the snow and ice at
               certain points, we made considerable use of the small melting apparatus and sunk bores
               and performed dynamiting at many places where no previous explorer had ever thought
               of securing mineral specimens. The 
               <mark class="scientific" title="0">pre-Cambrian</mark><span class="note"></span> granites and beacon sandstones thus obtained confirmed our belief that this plateau
               was homogeneous, with the great bulk of the continent to the west, but somewhat different
               from the parts lying eastward below South America--which we then thought to form a separate and smaller continent divided from the
               larger one by a frozen junction of Ross and Weddell Seas, though Byrd has since disproved the

            <p>In certain of the sandstones, dynamited and chiseled after boring revealed their nature,
               we found some highly interesting fossil markings and fragments; notably ferns, seaweeds,

               real significance in connection with the region's

               These fragments came from a point to the westward, near the Queen Alexandra Range; and Lake, as a biologist, seemed to find their curious marking unusually puzzling and provocative,
               though to my geological eye it looked not unlike some of the ripple effects reasonably
               common in the sedimentary rocks. Since slate is no more than a metamorphic formation
               into which a sedimentary stratum is pressed, and since the pressure itself produces
               odd distorting effects on any markings which may exist, I saw no reason for extreme
               wonder over the striated depression.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>On January 6th, 1931, Lake, Pabodie, Danforth, the other six students, and myself flew directly over the south pole in two of the
               great planes, being forced down once by a sudden high wind, which, fortunately, did
               not develop into a typical storm. This was, as the papers have stated, one of several
               observation flights, during others of which we tried to discern new topographical
               features in areas unreached by previous explorers. Our early flights were disappointing
               in this latter respect, though they afforded us some magnificent examples of the richly
               fantastic and deceptive mirages of the polar regions, of which our sea voyage had
               given us some brief foretastes. Distant mountains floated in the sky as enchanted
               cities, and often the whole white world would dissolve into a gold, silver, and scarlet
               land of 
               <mark class="other" title="0">Dunsanian</mark><span class="note"></span> dreams and adventurous expectancy under the magic of the low midnight sun. On cloudy
               days we had considerable trouble in flying owing to the tendency of snowy earth and
               sky to merge into one

            </p>
            
            
            <p>At length we resolved to carry out our original plan of flying five hundred miles
               eastward with all four exploring planes and establishing a fresh sub-base at a point
               which would probably be on the smaller continental division, as we mistakenly conceived
               it. Geological specimens obtained there would be desirable for purposes of comparison.
               Our health so far had remained excellent--lime juice well offsetting the steady diet
               of tinned and salted food, and temperatures generally above zero enabling us to do
               without our thickest furs. It was now midsummer, and with haste and care we might
               be able to conclude work by March and avoid a tedious wintering through the long

Several savage windstorms had burst upon us from the west, but we had escaped
               damage through the skill of Atwood in devising rudimentary aeroplane shelters and windbreaks of heavy snow blocks, and
               reinforcing the principal camp buildings with snow. Our good luck and efficiency had
               indeed been almost

            </p>
            
            
            <p>The outside world knew, of course, of our program, and was told also of Lake's strange and dogged insistence on a westward--or rather, northwestward--prospecting
               trip before our radical shift to the new base. It seems that he had pondered a great
               deal, and with alarmingly radical daring, over that triangular striated marking in
               the slate; reading into it certain contradictions in nature and geological period
               which whetted his curiosity to the utmost, and made him avid to sink more borings
               and blastings in the west-stretching formation to which the exhumed fragments evidently
               belonged. He was strangely convinced that the marking was the print of some bulky,
               unknown, and radically unclassifiable organism of considerably advanced

            <p>Popular imagination, I judge, responded actively to our wireless bulletins of Lake's start northwestward into regions never trodden by human foot or penetrated by human
               imagination, though we did not mention his wild hopes of revolutionizing the entire
               sciences of biology and geology. His preliminary sledging and boring journey of January 11th to 18th with Pabodie and five others--marred by the loss of two dogs in an upset when crossing one of
               the great pressure ridges in the ice--had brought up more and more of the

               in that unbelievably

                  of the Western Roman Empire<br /><strong>Synset('ancient.s.02'): </strong>very old<br /></span> stratum. These markings, however, were of very primitive life forms involving no
               great paradox except that any life forms should occur in rock as definitely 
               <mark class="scientific" title="0">pre-Cambrian</mark><span class="note"></span> as this seemed to be; hence I still failed to see the good sense of Lake's demand for an interlude in our time-saving program--an interlude requiring the use
               of all four planes, many men, and the whole of the expedition's mechanical apparatus.
               I did not, in the end, veto the plan, though I decided not to accompany the northwestward
               party despite Lake's plea for my geological advice. While they were gone, I would remain at the base with
               Pabodie and five men and work out final plans for the eastward shift. In preparation for
               this transfer, one of the planes had begun to move up a good gasoline supply from
               McMurdo Sound; but this could wait temporarily. I kept with me one sledge and nine dogs, since
               it is unwise to be at any time without possible transportation in an utterly tenantless
               world of 
               <mark class="scientific" title="0">aeon-long</mark><span class="note"></span> death.
            </p>
            
            
            
            <p>
               Lake's sub-expedition into the unknown, as everyone will recall, sent out its own reports
               from the shortwave transmitters on the planes; these being simultaneously picked up
               by our apparatus at the southern base and by the Arkham at McMurdo Sound, whence they were relayed to the outside world on wave lengths up to fifty meters.
               The start was made January 22nd at 4 A.M., and the first wireless message we received came only two hours later,
               when Lake spoke of descending and starting a small-scale ice-melting and bore at a point some
               three hundred miles away from us. Six hours after that a second and very excited message
               told of the frantic, beaver-like work whereby a shallow shaft had been sunk and blasted,
               culminating in the discovery of slate fragments with several markings approximately
               like the one which had caused the original puzzlement.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>Three hours later a brief bulletin announced the resumption of the flight in the teeth
               of a raw and piercing gale; and when I dispatched a message of protest against further
               hazards, Lake replied curtly that his new specimens made any hazard worth taking. I saw that his
               excitement had reached the point of mutiny, and that I could do nothing to check this
               headlong risk of the whole expedition's success; but it was appalling to think of
               his plunging deeper and deeper into that treacherous and sinister white immensity
               of tempests and unfathomed 
               <mark class="gothic" title="2">mysteries</mark><span class="note"><strong>Synset('mystery.n.01'): </strong>something that baffles understanding and cannot be explained<br /><strong>Synset('mystery.n.02'): </strong>a story about a crime (usually murder) presented as a novel or play or

               coast line of Queen Mary and Knox Lands.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>Then, in about an hour and a half more, came that doubly excited message from Lake's moving plane, which almost reversed my sentiments and made me wish I had accompanied
               the party:
            </p>

               black and bare of snow. Gale blowing off them impedes navigation."
            </p>
            
            
            <p>After that Pabodie, the men and I hung breathlessly over the receiver. Thought of this titanic mountain
               rampart seven hundred miles away inflamed our deepest sense of adventure; and we rejoiced
               that our expedition, if not ourselves personally, had been its discoverers. In half
               an hour Lake called us again:

            <p>Though it was technically sleeping time, not one of us listeners thought for a moment
               of retiring. It must have been a good deal the same at McMurdo Sound, where the supply cache and the Arkham were also getting the messages; for Captain Douglas gave out a call congratulating everybody on the important find, and Sherman, the cache operator, seconded his sentiments. We were sorry, of course, about the
               damaged aeroplane, but hoped it could be easily mended. Then, at 11 P.M., came another
               call from Lake:
            </p>

            <p>From then on for another half hour Lake kept up a running fire of comment, and expressed his intention of climbing some of
               the peaks on foot. I replied that I would join him as soon as he could send a plane,
               and that Pabodie and I would work out the best gasoline plan--just where and how to concentrate our
               supply in view of the expedition's altered character. Obviously, Lake's boring operations, as well as his aeroplane activities, would require a great deal
               for the new base which he planned to establish at the foot of the mountains; and it
               was possible that the eastward flight might not be made, after all, this season. In
               connection with this business I called Captain Douglas and asked him to get as much as possible out of the ships and up the barrier with
               the single dog team we had left there. A direct route across the unknown region between
               Lake and McMurdo Sound was what we really ought to establish.

               Lake called me later to say that he had decided to let the camp stay where Moulton's plane had been forced down, and where repairs had already progressed somewhat. The
               ice sheet was very thin, with dark ground here and there visible, and he would sink
               some borings and blasts at that very point before making any sledge trips or climbing
               expeditions. He spoke of the ineffable majesty of the whole scene, and the

               shot up like a wall reaching the sky at the world's rim. Atwood's theodolite observations had placed the height of the five tallest peaks at from thirty
               thousand to thirty-four thousand feet. The windswept nature of the terrain clearly
               disturbed Lake, for it argued the occasional existence of prodigious gales, violent beyond anything
               we had so far encountered. His camp lay a little more than five miles from where the
               higher foothills rose abruptly. I could almost trace a note of subconscious alarm
               in his words--flashed across a glacial void of seven hundred miles--as he urged that
               we all hasten with the matter and get the strange, new region disposed of as soon
               as possible. He was about to rest now, after a continuous day's work of almost unparalleled
               speed, strenuousness, and results.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>In the morning I had a three-cornered wireless talk with Lake and Captain Douglas at their widely separated bases. It was agreed that one of Lake's planes would come to my base for Pabodie, the five men, and myself, as well as for all the fuel it could carry. The rest of
               the fuel question, depending on our decision about an easterly trip, could wait for
               a few days, since Lake had enough for immediate camp heat and borings. Eventually the old southern base
               ought to be restocked, but if we postponed the easterly trip we would not use it till
               the next summer, and, meanwhile, Lake must send a plane to explore a direct route between his new mountains and McMurdo Sound.

            <p>
               Pabodie and I prepared to close our base for a short or long period, as the case might be.

Some of our conical tents had
               already been reinforced by blocks of hard snow, and now we decided to complete the
               job of making a permanent village. Owing to a very liberal tent supply, Lake had with him all that his base would need, even after our arrival. I wirelessed that
               Pabodie and I would be ready for the northwestward move after one day's work and one night's
               rest.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>Our labors, however, were not very steady after 4 P.M., for about that time Lake began sending in the most extraordinary and excited messages. His working day had
               started unpropitiously, since an aeroplane survey of the nearly-exposed rock surfaces

            <p>He had resolved, nevertheless, to do some local boring as part of the expedition's
               general program; hence he set up the drill and put five men to work with it while
               the rest finished settling the camp and repairing the damaged aeroplane. The softest
               visible rock--a sandstone about a quarter of a mile from the camp--had been chosen
               for the first sampling; and the drill made excellent progress without much supplementary
               blasting. It was about three hours afterward, following the first really heavy blast
               of the operation, that the shouting of the drill crew was heard; and that young Gedney--the acting foreman--rushed into the camp with the startling news.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>They had struck a cave. Early in the boring the sandstone had given place to a vein
               of 
               <mark class="scientific" title="0">Comanchian</mark><span class="note"></span> limestone, full of minute fossil cephalopods, corals, echini, and spirifera, and
               with occasional suggestions of siliceous sponges and marine vertebrate bones--the
               latter probably of teleosts, sharks, and ganoids. This, in itself, was important enough,
               as affording the first vertebrate fossils the expedition had yet secured; but when
               shortly afterward the drill head dropped through the stratum into apparent vacancy,
               a wholly new and doubly intense wave of excitement spread among the excavators. A
               good-sized blast had laid open the subterrene secret; and now, through a jagged aperture
               perhaps five feet across and three feet thick, there yawned before the avid searchers
               a section of shallow limestone hollowing worn more than fifty million years ago by

               Lake was not content to let his first message stand, but had another bulletin written
               and dispatched across the snow to the camp before Moulton could get back. After that Moulton stayed at the wireless in one of the planes, transmitting to me--and to the Arkham

               parts as requested; and my example was followed by Sherman from his station at the McMurdo Sound supply cache, as well as by Captain Douglas of the Arkham. Later, as head of the expedition, I added some remarks to be relayed
               through the Arkham to the outside world. Of course, rest was an absurd thought amidst
               this excitement; and my only wish was to get to Lake's camp as quickly as I could. It disappointed me when he sent word that a rising mountain
               gale made early aerial travel impossible.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>But within an hour and a half interest again rose to banish disappointment. Lake, sending more messages, told of the completely successful transportation of the fourteen
               great specimens to the camp. It had been a hard pull, for the things were surprisingly
               heavy; but nine men had accomplished it very neatly. Now some of the party were hurriedly
               building a snow corral at a safe distance from the camp, to which the dogs could be
               brought for greater convenience in feeding. The specimens were laid out on the hard
               snow near the camp, save for one on which Lake was making crude attempts at dissection.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>This dissection seemed to be a greater task than had been expected, for, despite the
               heat of a gasoline stove in the newly raised laboratory tent, the deceptively flexible
               tissues of the chosen specimen--a powerful and intact one--lost nothing of their more
               than leathery toughness. Lake was puzzled as to how he might make the requisite incisions without violence destructive
               enough to upset all the structural niceties he was looking for. He had, it is true,
               seven more perfect specimens; but these were too few to use up recklessly unless the
               cave might later yield an unlimited supply. Accordingly he removed the specimen and
               dragged in one which, though having remnants of the starfish arrangements at both
               ends, was badly crushed and partly disrupted along one of the great torso furrows.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>Results, quickly reported over the wireless, were baffling and provocative indeed.
               Nothing like delicacy or accuracy was possible with instruments hardly able to cut
               the anomalous tissue, but the little that was achieved left us all awed and bewildered.
               Existing biology would have to be wholly revised, for this thing was no product of
               any cell growth science knows about. There had been scarcely any mineral replacement,
               and despite an age of perhaps forty million years, the internal organs were wholly
               intact. The leathery, 
               <mark class="scientific" title="0">undeteriorative</mark><span class="note"></span>, and almost indestructible quality was an inherent attribute of the thing's form

               time Lake reached this stage, all thirty-seven dogs had been brought to the still uncompleted
               corral near the camp, and even at that distance set up a savage barking and show of
               restlessness at the acrid, diffusive smell.

               these one could hardly hesitate to call the thing animal; but internal inspection
               brought up so many vegetable evidences that Lake was left hopelessly at sea. It had digestion and circulation, and eliminated waste
               matter through the reddish tubes of its starfish-shaped base. Cursorily, one would
               say that its respiration apparatus handled oxygen rather than carbon dioxide, and
               there were odd evidences of air-storage chambers and methods of shifting respiration
               from the external orifice to at least two other fully developed breathing systems--gills
               and pores. Clearly, it was amphibian, and probably adapted to long airless hibernation
               periods as well. Vocal organs seemed present in connection with the main respiratory
               system, but they presented anomalies beyond immediate solution. Articulate speech,
               in the sense of syllable utterance, seemed barely conceivable, but musical piping
               notes covering a wide range were highly probable. The muscular system was almost prematurely

               shelters with snow on the mountainward side. These latter shelters, begun with hard
               snow blocks during odd moments, were by no means as high as they should have been;
               and Lake finally detached all hands from other tasks to work on them.

               would take when the shelter walls were a little higher. He held some friendly chat

Atwood also sent greetings and praises. I gave Lake a warm word of congratulations, owning up that he was right about the western trip,
               and we all agreed to get in touch by wireless at ten in the morning. If the gale was
               then over, Lake would send a plane for the party at my base. Just before retiring I dispatched a

            <p>III</p>
            
            
            <p>None of us, I imagine, slept very heavily or continuously that morning. Both the excitement
               of Lake's discovery and the mounting fury of the wind were against such a thing. So savage
               was the blast, even where we were, that we could not help wondering how much worse
               it was at Lake's camp, directly under the vast unknown peaks that bred and delivered it. McTighe was awake at ten o'clock and tried to get Lake on the wireless, as agreed, but some electrical condition in the disturbed air to
               the westward seemed to prevent communication. We did, however, get the Arkham, and
               Douglas told me that he had likewise been vainly trying to reach Lake. He had not known about the wind, for very little was blowing at McMurdo Sound, despite its persistent rage where we were.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>Throughout the day we all listened anxiously and tried to get Lake at intervals, but invariably without results. About noon a positive frenzy of wind
               stampeded out of the west, causing us to fear for the safety of our camp; but it eventually
               died down, with only a moderate relapse at 2 P.M. After three o'clock it was very
               quiet, and we redoubled our efforts to get Lake. Reflecting that he had four planes, each provided with an excellent short-wave outfit,
               we could not imagine any ordinary accident capable of crippling all his wireless equipment
               at once. Nevertheless the stony silence continued, and when we thought of the delirious
               force the wind must have had in his locality we could not help making the more direful
               conjectures.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>By six o'clock our fears had become intense and definite, and after a wireless consultation
               with Douglas and Thorfinnssen I resolved to take steps toward investigation. The fifth aeroplane, which we had
               left at the McMurdo Sound supply cache with Sherman and two sailors, was in good shape and ready for instant use, and it seemed that
               the very emergency for which it had been saved was now upon us. I got Sherman by wireless and ordered him to join me with the plane and the two sailors at the
               southern base as quickly as possible, the air conditions being apparently highly favorable.
               We then talked over the personnel of the coming investigation party, and decided that
               we would include all hands, together with the sledge and dogs which I had kept with
               me. Even so great a load would not be too much for one of the huge planes built to
               our special orders for heavy machinery transportation. At intervals I still tried
               to reach Lake with the wireless, but all to no purpose.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>
               Sherman, with the sailors Gunnarsson and Larsen, took off at 7:30, and reported a quiet flight from several points on the wing. They
               arrived at our base at midnight, and all hands at once discussed the next move. It
               was risky business sailing over the 
               <mark class="scientific" title="2">antarctic</mark><span class="note"><strong>Synset('antarctic.n.01'): </strong>the region around the south pole: Antarctica and surrounding waters<br /><strong>Synset('south-polar.s.01'): </strong>at or near the south pole<br /></span> in a single aeroplane without any line of bases, but no one drew back from what seemed
               like the plainest necessity. We turned in at two o'clock for a brief rest after some
               preliminary loading of the plane, but were up again in four hours to finish the loading
               and packing.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>At 7:15 A.M., January 25th, we started flying northwestward under McTighe's pilotage with ten men, seven dogs, a sledge, a fuel and food supply, and other items
               including the plane's wireless outfit. The atmosphere was clear, fairly quiet, and
               relatively mild in temperature, and we anticipated very little trouble in reaching
               the latitude and longitude designated by Lake as the site of his camp. Our apprehensions were over what we might find, or fail
               to find, at the end of our journey, for silence continued to answer all calls dispatched
               to the camp.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>Every incident of that four-and-a-half-hour flight is burned into my recollection
               because of its crucial position in my life. It marked my loss, at the age of fifty-four,
               of all that peace and balance which the normal mind possesses through its accustomed
               conception of external nature and nature's laws. Thenceforward the ten of us--but
               the student Danforth and myself above all others--were to face a hideously amplified world of lurking
               horrors which nothing can erase from our emotions, and which we would refrain from
               sharing with mankind in general if we could. The newspapers have printed the bulletins
               we sent from the moving plane, telling of our nonstop course, our two battles with
               treacherous upper-air gales, our glimpse of the broken surface where Lake had sunk his mid-journey shaft three days before, and our sight of a group of those
               strange fluffy snow cylinders noted by Amundsen and Byrd as rolling in the wind across the endless leagues of frozen plateau. There came a
               point, though, when our sensations could not be conveyed in any words the press would
               understand, and a latter point when we had to adopt an actual rule of strict censorship.

            <p>I was glad when the mirage began to break up, though in the process the various nightmare
               turrets and cones assumed distorted, temporary forms of even vaster hideousness. As
               the whole illusion dissolved to churning opalescence we began to look earthward again,
               and saw that our journey's end was not far off. The unknown mountains ahead rose dizzily
               up like a fearsome rampart of giants, their curious regularities showing with startling
               clearness even without a field glass. We were over the lowest foothills now, and could
               see amidst the snow, ice, and bare patches of their main plateau a couple of darkish
               spots which we took to be Lake's camp and boring. The higher foothills shot up between five and six miles away, forming
               a range almost distinct from the terrifying line of more than Himalayan peaks beyond
               them. At length Ropes--the student who had relieved McTighe at the controls--began to head downward toward the left-hand dark spot whose size
               marked it as the camp. As he did so, McTighe sent out the last uncensored wireless message the world was to receive from our expedition.

Some hours after our landing we sent a guarded report of the tragedy we
               found, and reluctantly announced the wiping out of the whole Lake party by the frightful wind of the preceding day, or of the night before that. Eleven
               known dead, young Gedney missing. People pardoned our hazy lack of details through realization of the shock
               the sad event must have caused us, and believed us when we explained that the mangling
               action of the wind had rendered all eleven bodies unsuitable for transportation outside.
               Indeed, I flatter myself that even in the midst of our distress, utter bewilderment,
               and soul-clutching horror, we scarcely went beyond the truth in any specific instance.
               The tremendous significance lies in what we dared not tell; what I would not tell
               now but for the need of warning others off from nameless terrors.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>It is a fact that the wind had brought dreadful havoc. Whether all could have lived
               through it, even without the other thing, is gravely open to doubt. The storm, with
               its fury of madly driven ice particles, must have been beyond anything our expedition
               had encountered before. One aeroplane shelter-wall, it seems, had been left in a far
               too flimsy and inadequate state--was nearly pulverized--and the derrick at the distant
               boring was entirely shaken to pieces. The exposed metal of the grounded planes and
               drilling machinery was bruised into a high polish, and two of the small tents were
               flattened despite their snow banking. Wooden surfaces left out in the blaster were
               pitted and denuded of paint, and all signs of tracks in the snow were completely obliterated.
               It is also true that we found none of the 
               <mark class="scientific" title="1">Archaean</mark><span class="note"><strong>Synset('archean.s.01'): </strong>of or relating to the earliest known rocks formed during the Precambrian
                  Eon<br /></span> biological objects in a condition to take outside as a whole. We did gather some
               minerals from a vast, tumbled pile, including several of the greenish soapstone fragments
               whose odd five-pointed rounding and faint patterns of grouped dots caused so many
               doubtful comparisons; and some fossil bones, among which were the most typical of
               the curiously injured specimens.

            <p>None of the dogs survived, their hurriedly built snow inclosure near the camp being
               almost wholly destroyed. The wind may have done that, though the greater breakage
               on the side next the camp, which was not the windward one, suggests an outward leap
               or break of the frantic

All three sledges were gone, and we have tried to explain that the wind
               may have blown them off into the unknown. The drill and ice-melting machinery at the
               boring were too badly damaged to warrant salvage, so we used them to choke up that
               subtly disturbing gateway to the past which Lake had blasted. We likewise left at the camp the two most shaken up of the planes; since
               our surviving party had only four real pilots--Sherman, Danforth, McTighe, and Ropes--in all, with Danforth in a poor nervous shape to navigate. We brought back all the books, scientific equipment,
               and other incidentals we could find, though much was rather unaccountably blown away.
               Spare tents and furs were either missing or badly out of condition.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>It was approximately 4 P.M., after wide plane cruising had forced us to give Gedney up for lost, that we sent our guarded message to the Arkham for relaying; and I think
               we did well to keep it as calm and noncommittal as we succeeded in doing. The most
               we said about agitation concerned our dogs, whose frantic uneasiness near the biological

            <p>About the fourteen biological specimens, we were pardonably indefinite. We said that
               the only ones we discovered were damaged, but that enough was left of them to prove
               Lake's description wholly and impressively accurate. It was hard work keeping our personal
               emotions out of this matter--and we did not mention numbers or say exactly how we
               had found those which we did find. We had by that time agreed not to transmit anything
               suggesting madness on the part of Lake's men, and it surely looked like madness to find six imperfect

            <p>We were careful, too, about the public's general peace of mind; hence Danforth and I said little about that frightful trip over the mountains the next day. It was
               the fact that only a radically lightened plane could possibly cross a range of such
               height, which mercifully limited that scouting tour to the two of us. On our return

            <p>This body of data is in every respect true so far as it goes, and it completely satisfied
               the men at the camp. We laid our absence of sixteen hours--a longer time than our
               announced flying, landing, reconnoitering, and rock-collecting program called for--to
               a long

               Fortunately our tale sounded realistic and prosaic enough not to tempt any of the
               others into emulating our flight. Had any tried to do that, I would have used every
               ounce of my persuasion to stop them--and I do not know what Danforth would have done. While we were gone, Pabodie, Sherman, Ropes, McTighe, and Williamson had worked like beavers over Lake's two best planes, fitting them again for use despite the altogether unaccountable
               juggling of their operative mechanism.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>We decided to load all the planes the next morning and start back for our old base
               as soon as possible. Even though indirect, that was the safest way to work toward
               McMurdo Sound; for a straightline flight across the most utterly unknown stretches of the 
               <mark class="other" title="0">aeon-dead</mark><span class="note"></span> continent would involve many additional hazards. Further exploration was hardly feasible
               in view of our tragic decimation and the ruin of our drilling machinery. The doubts
               and horrors around us--which we did not reveal--made us wish only to escape from this
               austral world of desolation and brooding madness as swiftly as we could.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>As the public knows, our return to the world was accomplished without further disasters.
               All planes reached the old base on the evening of the next day--January 27th--after a swift nonstop flight; and on the 28th we made McMurdo Sound in two laps, the one pause being very brief, and occasioned by a faulty rudder in
               the furious wind over the ice shelf after we had cleared the great plateau. In five
               days more, the Arkham and Miskatonic, with all hands and equipment on board, were shaking clear of the thickening field
               ice and working up

               my soul to the quick. Less than a fortnight later we left the last hint of polar land

               unity and faithfulness. Even young Danforth, with his nervous breakdown, has not flinched or babbled to his doctors--indeed,
               as I have said, there is one thing he thinks he alone saw which he will not tell even
               me, though I think it would help his

               the thing was no more than the delusive aftermath of an earlier shock. That is the

            <p>It will be hard work deterring others from the great white south, and some of our
               efforts may directly harm our cause by drawing inquiring notice. We might have known
               from the first that human curiosity is undying, and that the results we announced
               would be enough to spur others ahead on the same age-long pursuit of the unknown.

               sensible enough not to show the detached parts we had taken from the actual buried
               specimens, or our photographs of those specimens as they were found. We also refrained
               from showing the more puzzling of the scarred bones and greenish soapstones; while
               Danforth and I have closely guarded the pictures we took or drew on the superplateau across
               the range, and the crumpled things we smoothed, studied in terror, and brought away
               in our pockets.

            <p>But now that Starkweather-Moore party is organizing, and with a thoroughness far beyond
               anything our outfit attempted. If not dissuaded, they will get to the innermost nucleus

So I must
               break through all reticences at last--even about that ultimate, nameless thing beyond
               the mountains of madness.

            <p>It is only with vast hesitancy and repugnance that I let my mind go back to Lake's camp and what we really found there--and to that other thing beyond the mountains
               of madness. I am constantly tempted to shirk the details, and to let hints stand for
               actual facts and ineluctable deductions. I hope I have said enough already to let
               me glide briefly over the rest; the rest, that is, of the horror at the camp. I have
               told of the wind-ravaged terrain, the damaged shelters, the disarranged machinery,
               the varied uneasiness of our dogs, the missing sledges and other items, the deaths
               of men and dogs, the absence of Gedney, and the six insanely buried biological specimens, strangely sound in texture for
               all their structural injuries, from a world forty million years dead. I do not recall
               whether I mentioned that upon checking up the canine bodies we found one dog missing.
               We did not think much about that till later--indeed, only Danforth and I have thought of it at all.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>The principal things I have been keeping back relate to the bodies, and to certain
               subtle points which may or may not lend a hideous and incredible kind of rationale
               to the apparent chaos. At the time, I tried to keep the men's minds off those points;
               for it was so much simpler--so much more normal--to lay everything to an outbreak
               of madness on the part of some of Lake's party. From the look of things, that

               or laceration. The dogs had evidently started the trouble, for the state of their
               ill-built corral bore witness to its forcible breakage from within. It had been set

            <p>But whatever had happened, it was hideous and revolting enough. Perhaps I had better
               put squeamishness aside and tell the worst at last--though with a categorical statement
               of opinion, based on the first-hand observations and most rigid deductions of both
               Danforth and myself, that the then missing Gedney was in no way responsible for the loathsome horrors we found. I have said that the
               bodies were frightfully mangled. Now I must add that some were incised and subtracted
               from in the most curious, cold-blooded, and

It was the same with dogs and men. All the healthier, fatter bodies, quadrupedal
               or bipedal, had had their most solid masses of tissue cut out and removed, as by a
               careful butcher; and around them was a strange sprinkling of salt--taken from the
               ravaged provision chests on the planes--which conjured up the most horrible associations.
               The thing had occurred in one of the crude aeroplane shelters from which the plane
               had been dragged out, and subsequent winds had effaced all tracks which could have
               supplied any plausible theory. Scattered bits of clothing, roughly slashed from the
               human incision subjects, hinted no clues. It is useless to bring up the half impression
               of certain faint snow prints in one shielded corner of the ruined inclosure--because
               that impression did not concern human prints at all, but was clearly mixed up with
               all the talk of fossil prints which poor Lake had been giving throughout the preceding weeks. One had to be careful of one's imagination
               in the lee of those overshadowing mountains of madness.

            <p>As I have indicated, Gedney and one dog turned out to be missing in the end. When we came on that terrible shelter

               everybody so far as spoken utterance was concerned; though I will not be so naive
               as to deny that each of us may have harbored wild guesses which sanity forbade him
               to formulate completely. Sherman, Pabodie, and McTighe made an exhaustive aeroplane cruise over all the surrounding territory in the afternoon,
               sweeping the horizon with field glasses in quest of Gedney and of the various missing things; but nothing came to light. The party reported
               that the titan barrier range extended endlessly to right and left alike, without any
               diminution in height or essential structure. On some of the peaks, though, the regular
               cube and rampart formations were bolder and plainer, having doubly fantastic similitudes

               altitude flights in a lightened plane with aerial camera and geologist's outfit, beginning
               the following morning. It was decided that Danforth and I try it first, and we awaked at 7 A.M. intending an early flight; however, heavy
               winds--mentioned in our brief bulletin to the outside world--delayed our start till

               he thinks he alone saw--even though it was probably a nervous delusion--and which
               was perhaps the last straw that put him where he is; but he is firm against that.

               Danforth and I, studying the notes made by Pabodie in his afternoon flight and checking up with a sextant, had calculated that the lowest
               available pass in the range lay somewhat to the right of us, within sight of camp,
               and about twenty-three thousand or twenty-four thousand feet above sea level. For
               this point, then, we first headed in the lightened plane as we embarked on our flight
               of discovery. The camp itself, on foothills which sprang from a high continental plateau,
               was some twelve thousand feet in altitude; hence the actual height increase necessary
               was not so vast as it might seem. Nevertheless we were acutely conscious of the rarefied
               air and intense cold as we rose; for, on account of visibility conditions, we had
               to leave the cabin windows open. We were dressed, of course, in our heaviest furs.

            <p>As we drew near the forbidding peaks, dark and sinister above the line of crevasse-riven
               snow and interstitial glaciers, we noticed more and more the curiously regular formations
               clinging to the slopes; and thought again of the strange Asian paintings of Nicholas Roerich. The

               years. How much higher they had once been, it was futile to guess; but everything
               about this strange region pointed to obscure atmospheric influences unfavorable to

               was purely an amateur's--in order to let him use the binoculars. We could easily see

               seemed invariably smooth and regular; and Danforth thought that the slight cracks and pittings of the weathering tended toward unusual

               low pass we had selected. As we advanced we occasionally looked down at the snow and
               ice of the land route, wondering whether we could have attempted the trip with the
               simpler equipment of earlier days. Somewhat to our surprise we saw that the terrain
               was far from difficult as such things go; and that despite the crevasses and other
               bad spots it would not have been likely to deter the sledges of a Scott, a Shackleton, or an Amundsen. Some of the glaciers appeared to lead up to wind-bared passes with unusual continuity,

            <p>The plane's fuel tank, in the interest of greater lightness, had been only partly
               filled; hence we now had to exert caution in our explorations. Even so, however, we
               covered an enormous extent of ground--or, rather, air--after swooping down to a level
               where the wind became virtually negligible. There seemed to be no limit to the mountain
               range, or to the length of the frightful stone city which bordered its inner foothills.
               Fifty miles of flight in each direction showed no major change in the labyrinth of
               rock and masonry that clawed up corpselike through the eternal ice. There were, though,
               some highly absorbing diversifications; such as the carvings on the canyon where that
               broad river had once pierced the foothills and approached its sinking place in the
               great range. The headlands at the stream's entrance had been boldly carved into

               out into some sort of rambling-stone edifice; but there were at least two exceptions.

            <p>So far we had made no landing, yet to leave the plateau without an attempt at entering

Accordingly, we decided to find a smooth
               place on the foothills near our navigable pass, there grounding the plane and preparing
               to do some exploration on foot. Though these gradual slopes were partly covered with
               a scattering of ruins, low flying soon disclosed an ampler number of possible landing
               places. Selecting that nearest to the pass, since our flight would be across the great
               range and back to camp, we succeeded about 12:30 P.M. in effecting a landing on a
               smooth, hard snow field wholly devoid of obstacles and well adapted to a swift and
               favorable take-off later on.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>It did not seem necessary to protect the plane with a snow banking for so brief a
               time and in so comfortable an absence of high winds at this level; hence we merely
               saw that the landing skis were safely lodged, and that the vital parts of the mechanism
               were guarded against the cold. For our foot journey we discarded the heaviest of our
               flying furs, and took with us a small outfit consisting of pocket compass, hand camera,
               light provisions, voluminous notebooks and paper, geologist's hammer and chisel, specimen
               bags, coil of climbing rope, and powerful electric torches with extra batteries; this
               equipment having been carried in the plane on the chance that we might be able to
               effect a landing, take ground pictures, make drawings and topographical sketches,
               and obtain rock specimens from some bare slope, outcropping, or mountain cave. Fortunately
               we had a supply of extra paper to tear up, place in a spare specimen bag, and use

            <p>Walking cautiously downhill over the crusted snow toward the stupendous stone labyrinth

               marvels as we had felt on approaching the unfathomed mountain pass four hours previously.
               True, we had become visually familiar with the incredible secret concealed by the
               barrier peaks; yet the prospect of actually entering

Though the thinness of the air at this prodigious altitude made exertion somewhat
               more difficult than usual, both Danforth and I found ourselves bearing up very well, and felt equal to almost any task which
               might fall to our lot. It took only a few steps to bring us to a shapeless ruin worn
               level with the snow, while ten or fifteen rods farther on there was a huge, roofless
               rampart still complete in its gigantic five-pointed outline and rising to an irregular

There was a
               row of arched loopholes or windows about four feet wide and five feet high, spaced
               quite symmetrically along the points of the star and at its inner angles, and with
               the bottoms about four feet from the glaciated surface. Looking through these, we
               could see that the masonry was fully five feet thick, that there were no partitions
               remaining within, and that there were traces of banded carvings or bas-reliefs on
               the interior walls--facts we had indeed guessed before, when flying low over this
               rampart and others like it. Though lower parts must have originally existed, all traces
               of such things were now wholly obscured by the deep layer of ice and snow at this
               point.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>We crawled through one of the windows and vainly tried to decipher the nearly effaced
               mural designs, but did not attempt to disturb the glaciated floor. Our orientation
               flights had indicated that many buildings in the city proper were less ice-choked,
               and that we might perhaps find wholly clear interiors leading down to the true ground

               we photographed it carefully, and studied its mortar-less

            <p>The half-mile walk downhill to the actual city, with the upper wind shrieking vainly
               and savagely through the skyward peaks in the background, was something of which the
               smallest details will always remain engraved on my mind. Only in fantastic nightmares
               could any human beings but Danforth and me conceive such optical effects. Between us and the churning vapors of the west

            <p>Our field glasses showed the external, horizontal bands of nearly effaced sculptures
               and dot groups to be very prevalent, and we could half imagine what the city must
               once have looked like--even though most of the roofs and tower tops had necessarily
               perished. As a whole, it had been a complex tangle of twisted lanes and alleys, all
               of them deep canyons, and some little better than tunnels because of the overhanging
               masonry or overarching bridges. Now, outspread below us, it loomed like a dream fantasy
               against a westward mist through whose northern end the low, reddish

               encountered a denser obstruction and plunged the scene into temporary shadow, the
               effect was subtly menacing in a way I can never hope to depict. Even the faint howling
               and piping of the unfelt wind in the great mountain passes behind us took on a wilder
               note of purposeful malignity. The last stage of our descent to the town was unusually
               steep and abrupt, and a rock outcropping at the edge where the grade changed led us
               to think that an artificial terrace had once existed there. Under the glaciation,
               we believed, there must be a flight of steps or its equivalent.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>When at last we plunged into the town itself, clambering over fallen masonry and shrinking
               from the oppressive nearness and dwarfing height of omnipresent crumbling and pitted
               walls, our sensations again became such that I marvel at the amount of self-control
               we retained. Danforth was frankly jumpy, and began making some offensively irrelevant speculations about
               the horror at the camp--which I resented all the more because I could not help sharing
               certain conclusions forced upon us by many features of this morbid survival from nightmare
               antiquity. The speculations worked on his imagination, too; for in one place--where
               a debris-littered alley turned a sharp corner--he insisted that he saw faint traces
               of ground markings which he did not like; whilst elsewhere he stopped to listen to
               a subtle, imaginary sound from some undefined point--a muffled musical piping, he
               said, not unlike that of the wind in the mountain caves, yet somehow disturbingly
               different. The ceaseless five-pointedness of the surrounding architecture and of the

            <p>Nevertheless, our scientific and adventurous souls were not wholly dead, and we mechanically
               carried out our program of chipping specimens from all the different rock types represented
               in the masonry. We wished a rather full set in order to draw better conclusions regarding
               the age of the place. Nothing in the great outer walls seemed to date from later than

               five hundred thousand years, and in all probability even longer.

            <p>As we proceeded through this maze of stone-shadowed twilight we stopped at all available
               apertures to study interiors and investigate entrance possibilities. Some were above
               our reach, whilst others led only into ice-choked ruins as unroofed and barren as
               the rampart on the hill. One, though spacious and inviting, opened on a seemingly

               place, thus surviving the rusting of their former and probably metallic fixtures and
               fastenings.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>After a time we came across a row of windows--in the bulges of a colossal five-edged
               cone of undamaged apex--which led into a vast, well-preserved room with stone flooring;
               but these were too high in the room to permit descent without a rope. We had a rope
               with us, but did not wish to bother with this twenty-foot drop unless obliged to--especially
               in this thin plateau air where great demands were made upon the heart action. This
               enormous room was probably a hall or concourse of some sort, and our electric torches
               showed bold, distinct, and potentially startling sculptures arranged round the walls
               in broad, horizontal bands separated by equally broad strips of conventional

               interior were encountered.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>Finally, though, we did encounter exactly the opening we wished; an archway about
               six feet wide and ten feet high, marking the former end of an aerial bridge which
               had spanned an alley about five feet above the present level of glaciation. These
               archways, of course, were flush with upper-story floors, and in this case one of the
               floors still existed. The building thus accessible was a series of rectangular terraces
               on our left facing westward. That across the alley, where the other archway yawned,
               was a decrepit cylinder with no windows and with a curious bulge about ten feet above
               the aperture. It was totally dark inside, and the archway seemed to open on a well
               of illimitable emptiness.

               a moment we hesitated before taking advantage of the long-wished chance. For though

               however, we made the plunge, and scrambled up over the rubble into the gaping

            <p>Observing the many inner archways which led off from it, and realizing the probable
               complexity of the nest of apartments within, we decided that we must begin our system
               of hare-and-hound trail blazing. Hitherto our compasses, together with frequent glimpses
               of the vast mountain range between the towers in our rear, had been enough to prevent
               our losing our way; but from now on, the artificial substitute would be necessary.
               Accordingly we reduced our extra paper to shreds of suitable size, placed these in
               a bag to be carried by Danforth, and prepared to use them as economically as safety would allow. This method would
               probably gain us immunity from straying, since there did not appear to be any strong
               air currents inside the

            <p>Just how extensive a territory we had opened up, it was impossible to guess without
               a trial. The close and frequent connection of the different buildings made it likely
               that we might cross from one to another on bridges underneath the ice, except where

               we even now have only the barest outline--and much of that was obtained later on from
               a study of the photographs and sketches we made. It may be the effect of this later
               study--the revived memories and vague impressions acting in conjunction with his general
               sensitiveness and with that final supposed horror-glimpse whose essence he will not
               reveal even to me--which has been the immediate source of Danforth's present breakdown. But it had to be; for we could not issue our warning intelligently
               without the fullest possible information, and the issuance of that warning is a prime
               necessity. Certain lingering influences in that unknown

They had lived under the sea a good deal, building fantastic cities and
               fighting terrific battles with nameless adversaries by means of intricate devices
               employing unknown principles of energy. Evidently their scientific and mechanical
               knowledge far surpassed man's today, though they made use of its more widespread and
               elaborate forms only when obliged to. Some of the sculptures suggested that they had

            <p>It was under the sea, at first for food and later for other purposes, that they first
               created earth life--using available substances according to long-known methods. The
               more elaborate experiments came after the annihilation of various cosmic enemies.
               They had done the same thing on other planets, having manufactured not only necessary
               foods, but certain multicellular 
               <mark class="scientific" title="0">protoplasmic</mark><span class="note"></span> masses capable of molding their tissues into all sorts of temporary organs under

               dreams of those who had chewed a certain alkaloidal herb. When the star-headed OldOnes
               on this planet had synthesized their simple food forms and bred a good supply of Shoggoths,
               they allowed other cell groups to develop into other forms of animal and vegetable
               life for sundry purposes, extirpating any whose presence became troublesome.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>With the aid of the Shoggoths, whose expansions could be made to lift prodigious weights, the small, low cities
               under the sea grew to vast and imposing labyrinths of stone not unlike those which
               later rose on land. Indeed, the highly adaptable Old Ones had lived much on land in other parts of the universe, and probably retained many
               traditions of land construction. As we studied the architecture of all these sculptured
               palaeogean cities, including that whose 
               <mark class="other" title="0">aeon-dead</mark><span class="note"></span> corridors we were even then traversing, we were impressed by a curious coincidence
               which we have not yet tried to explain, even to ourselves. The tops of the buildings,
               which in the actual city around us had, of course, been weathered into shapeless ruins
               ages ago, were clearly displayed in the bas-reliefs, and showed vast clusters of needle-like

            <p>The toughness of the things was almost incredible. Even the terrific pressure of the
               deepest sea bottoms appeared powerless to harm them. Very few seemed to die at all
               except by violence, and their burial places were very limited. The fact that they
               covered their vertically inhumed dead with five-pointed inscribed mounds set up thoughts
               in Danforth and me which made a fresh pause and recuperation necessary after the sculptures revealed
               it. The beings multiplied by means of spores--like vegetable 
               <mark class="scientific" title="1">pteridophytes</mark><span class="note"><strong>Synset('pteridophyte.n.01'): </strong>plants having vascular tissue and reproducing by spores<br /></span>, as Lake had suspected--but, owing to their prodigious toughness and longevity, and consequent
               lack of replacement needs, they did not encourage the large-scale development of new
               prothallia except when they had new regions to colonize. The young matured swiftly,
               and received an education evidently beyond any standard we can imagine. The prevailing
               intellectual and aesthetic life was highly evolved, and produced a tenaciously enduring
               set of customs and institutions which I shall describe more fully in my coming monograph.
               These varied slightly according to sea or land residence, but had the same foundations
               and essentials.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>Though able, like vegetables, to derive nourishment from inorganic substances, they
               vastly preferred organic and especially animal food. They ate uncooked marine life
               under the sea, but cooked their viands on land. They hunted game and raised meat herds--slaughtering
               with sharp weapons whose odd marks on certain fossil bones our expedition had noted.
               They resisted all ordinary temperatures marvelously, and in their natural state could
               live in water down to freezing. When the great chill of the 
               <mark class="scientific" title="1">Pleistocene</mark><span class="note"><strong>Synset('pleistocene.n.01'): </strong>from two million to 11 thousand years ago; extensive glaciation of the northern
                  hemisphere; the time of human evolution<br /></span> drew on, however--nearly a million years ago--the land dwellers had to resort to
               special measures, including artificial heating--until at last the deadly cold appears
               to have driven them back into the sea. For their prehistoric flights through cosmic
               space,

               or heat conditions--but by the time of the great cold they had lost track of the method.
               In any case they could not have prolonged the artificial state indefinitely without
               harm.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>Being nonpairing and semivegetable in structure, the Old Ones had no biological basis for the family phase of mammal life, but seemed to organize
               large households on the principles of comfortable space-utility and--as we deduced
               from the pictured occupations and diversions of co-dwellers--congenial mental association.
               In furnishing their homes they kept everything in the center of the huge rooms, leaving
               all the wall spaces free for decorative treatment. Lighting, in the case of the land
               inhabitants, was accomplished by a device probably 
               <mark class="scientific" title="0">electro-chemical</mark><span class="note"></span> in nature. Both on land and under water they used curious tables, chairs and couches
               like cylindrical frames--for they rested and slept upright with folded-down

               There was extensive commerce, both local and between different cities--certain small,
               flat counters, five-pointed and inscribed, serving as money. Probably the smaller
               of the various greenish soapstones found by our expedition were pieces of such currency.
               Though the culture was mainly urban, some agriculture and much stock raising existed.
               Mining and a limited amount of manufacturing were also practiced. Travel was very
               frequent, but permanent migration seemed relatively rare except for the vast colonizing
               movements by which the race expanded. For personal

            <p>With the upheaval of new land in the South Pacific tremendous events began. Some of the marine cities were hopelessly shattered, yet
               that was not the worst misfortune. Another race--a land race of beings shaped like
               octopi and probably corresponding to fabulous

               which for a time drove the Old Ones wholly back to the sea--a colossal blow in view of the increasing land settlements.
               Later peace was made, and the new lands were given to the 
               <mark class="other" title="0">Cthulhu</mark><span class="note"></span> spawn whilst the Old Ones held the sea and the older lands. New land cities were founded--the greatest of them

               <mark class="other" title="0">Cthulhu</mark><span class="note"></span> spawn were blotted out. Then suddenly the lands of the Pacific sank again, taking
               with them the frightful stone city of R'lyeh and all the cosmic octopi, so that the
               Old Ones were again supreme on the planet except for one shadowy fear about which they did
               not like to speak. At a rather later age their cities dotted all the land and water
               areas of the globe--hence the recommendation in my coming monograph that some archaeologist
               make systematic borings with Pabodie's type of apparatus in certain widely separated regions.

            <p>The steady trend down the ages was from water to land--a movement encouraged by the
               rise of new land masses, though the ocean was never wholly deserted. Another cause
               of the landward movement was the new difficulty in breeding and managing the Shoggoths upon which successful sea life depended. With the march of time, as the sculptures
               sadly confessed, the art of creating new life from inorganic matter had been lost,
               so that the Old Ones had to depend on the molding of forms already in existence. On land the great reptiles
               proved highly tractable; but theShoggoths of the sea, reproducing by fission and acquiring a dangerous degree of accidental
               intelligence, presented for a time a formidable problem.

            <p>Naturally, Danforth and I studied with especial interest and a peculiarly personal sense of awe everything
               pertaining to the immediate district in which we were. Of this local material there
               was naturally a vast abundance; and on the tangled ground level of the city we were
               lucky enough to find a house of very late date whose walls, though somewhat damaged
               by a neighboring rift, contained sculptures of decadent workmanship carrying the story
               of the region much beyond the period of the

               plateau of Leng which even the mad author of the Necronomicon was reluctant to discuss. The great mountain chain was tremendously long--starting
               as a low range at Luitpold Land on the east coast of Weddell Sea and virtually crossing the entire continent. That really high part stretched in a
               mighty arc from about  E. Longitude 115Â°, with its concave side toward our camp and its seaward end in the region of that
               long, ice-locked coast whose hills were glimpsed by Lake's and Lake's at the

               evil. Cities built there had crumbled before their time, and had been found suddenly
               deserted. Then when the first great earth buckling had convulsed the region in the
               
               <mark class="scientific" title="0">Comanchian</mark><span class="note"></span>Age, a frightful line of peaks had shot suddenly up amidst the most appalling din

               their dreaded summits in the dim western distance had it not been for that vague,
               opalescent haze. Their northern end must likewise be visible from the long

            <p>Some of the Old Ones, in the decadent days, had made strange prayers to those mountains--but none ever
               went near them or dared to guess what lay beyond. No human eye had ever seen them,
               and as I studied the emotions conveyed in the carvings, I prayed that none ever might.
               There are protecting hills along the coast beyond them--Queen Mary and Kaiser Wilhelm Lands--and I thank Heaven no one has been able to land and climb those hills. I am not as sceptical about old
               tales and fears as I used to be, and I do not laugh now at the

            <p>But the terrain close at hand was hardly less strange, even if less namelessly accursed.
               Soon after the founding of the city the great mountain range became the seat of the

               the mountains, the foothills, and the plains below them were a veritable network of
               connected caverns and galleries. Many graphic sculptures told of explorations deep
               underground, and of the final discovery of the

            <p>This vast nighted gulf had undoubtedly been worn by the great river which flowed down
               from the nameless and horrible westward mountains, and which had formerly turned at
               the base of the Old Ones' range and flowed beside that chain into the Indian Ocean between Budd and Totten Lands on Lake's coast line. Little by little it had eaten away the limestone hill base at its turning,
               till at last its sapping currents reached the caverns of the ground waters and joined

            <p>This river, once crossed by scores of noble stone bridges, was plainly the one whose

               of the city helped us to orient ourselves to the scene as it had been at various stages

               <mark class="other" title="0">aeon-dead</mark><span class="note"></span> history, so that we were able to sketch a hasty but careful map of the salient features--squares,

            <p>It was only in the one late-built house with the decadent carvings that we obtained
               any foreshadowing of the final calamity leading to the city's desertion. Undoubtedly
               there must have been many sculptures of the same age elsewhere, even allowing for
               the slackened energies and aspirations of a stressful and uncertain period; indeed,
               very certain evidence of the existence of others came to us shortly afterward. But
               this was the first and only set we directly encountered. We meant to look farther
               later on; but as I have said, immediate conditions dictated another present objective.
               There would, though, have been a limit--for after all hope of a long future occupancy
               of the place had perished among the Old Ones, there could not but have been a complete cessation of mural decoration. The ultimate
               blow, of course, was the coming of the great cold which once held most of the earth
               in

Nowadays we set the beginning of
               the general glacial periods at a distance of about five hundred thousand years from
               the present, but at the poles the terrible scourge must have commenced much earlier.
               All quantitative estimates are partly guesswork, but it is quite likely that the decadent
               sculptures were made considerably less than a million years ago, and that the actual
               desertion of the city was complete long before the conventional opening of the

               to adapt some of the amorphous and curiously cold-resistant Shoggoths to land life--a thing the Old Ones had formerly been reluctant to do. The great river was now lifeless, and the upper
               sea had lost most of its denizens except the seals and whales. All the birds had flown

               been delivered? Had any of the Old Ones shifted north ahead of the creeping ice cap? Existing geology shows no trace of their

               according to their location, certainly not less than thirty million years old, and
               we reflected that in their day the sea-cavern city, and indeed the cavern itself,
               had had no existence. They would have remembered an older scene, with lush Tertiary

            <p>I have said that our study of the decadent sculptures brought about a change in our
               immediate objective. This, of course, had to do with the chiseled avenues to the black
               inner world, of whose existence we had not known before, but which we were now eager
               to find and traverse. From the evident scale of the carvings we deduced that a steeply
               descending walk of about a mile through either of the neighboring tunnels would bring
               us to the brink of the dizzy, sunless cliffs about the great

               gulf in stark reality was a lure which seemed impossible of resistance once we knew
               of the thing--yet we realized we must begin the quest at once if we expected to include
               it in our present trip.

            <p>It was now 8 P.M., and we did not have enough battery replacements to let our torches
               burn on forever. We had done so much studying and copying below the glacial level
               that our battery supply had had at least five hours of nearly continuous use, and
               despite the special dry cell formula, would obviously be good for only about four
               more--though by keeping one torch unused, except for especially interesting or difficult
               places, we might manage to eke out a safe margin beyond that. It would not do to be
               without a light in these

               be possible, even in case of really lost direction, to work up to full daylight by
               one channel or another if granted sufficient time for plentiful trial and error. So
               at last we set off eagerly in the indicated direction of the nearest tunnel.

            <p>According to the carvings from which we had made our map, the desired tunnel mouth
               could not be much more than a quarter of a mile from where we stood; the intervening
               space showing solid-looking buildings quite likely to be penetrable still at a sub-glacial
               level. The opening itself would be in the basement--on the angle nearest the foothills--of
               a vast five-pointed structure of evidently public and perhaps ceremonial nature, which
               we tried to identify from our

            <p>No such structure came to our minds as we recalled our flight, hence we concluded
               that its upper parts had been greatly damaged, or that it had been totally shattered
               in an ice rift we had noticed. In the latter case the tunnel would probably turn out
               to be choked, so that we would have to try the next nearest one--the one less than
               a mile to the north. The intervening river course prevented our trying any of the
               more southern tunnels on this trip; and indeed, if both of the neighboring ones were
               choked it was doubtful whether our batteries would warrant an attempt on the next
               northerly one--about a mile beyond our second choice.

            <p>As we threaded our dim way through the labyrinth with the aid of map and compass--traversing
               rooms and corridors in every stage of ruin or preservation, clambering up ramps, crossing
               upper floors and bridges and clambering down again, encountering choked doorways and
               piles of debris, hastening now and then along finely preserved and

               the blind paper trail we had left), and once in a while striking the bottom of an
               open shaft through which daylight poured or trickled down--we were repeatedly tantalized
               by the sculptured walls along our route. Many must have told tales of immense historical
               importance, and only the prospect of later visits reconciled us to the need of passing
               them by. As it was, we slowed down once in a while and turned on our second torch.
               If we had had more films, we would certainly have paused briefly to photograph certain
               bas-reliefs, but time-consuming hand-copying was clearly out of the question.

            <p>I come now once more to a place where the temptation to hesitate, or to hint rather
               than state, is very strong. It is necessary, however, to reveal the rest in order
               to justify my course in discouraging further exploration. We had wormed our way very
               close to the computed site of the tunnel's mouth--having crossed a second-story bridge
               to what seemed plainly the tip of a pointed wall, and descended to a ruinous corridor
               especially rich in decadently elaborate and apparently

               a dog with us, I suppose we would have been warned before. At first we could not precisely
               say what was wrong with the formerly crystal-pure air, but after a few seconds our
               memories reacted only too definitely. Let me try to state the thing without flinching.
               There was an odor--and that odor was vaguely, subtly, and unmistakably akin to what
               had nauseated us upon opening the 
               <mark class="other" title="2">insane</mark><span class="note"><strong>Synset('insane.a.01'): </strong>afflicted with or characteristic of mental derangement<br /><strong>Synset('harebrained.s.01'): </strong>very foolish<br /></span> grave of the horror poor Lake had dissected.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>Of course the revelation was not as clearly cut at the time as it sounds now. There
               were several conceivable explanations, and we did a good deal of indecisive whispering.
               Most important of all, we did not retreat without further investigation; for having
               come this far, we were loath to be balked by anything short of certain disaster. Anyway,
               what we must have suspected was altogether too wild to believe. Such things did not
               happen in any normal world. It was probably sheer irrational instinct which made us
               dim our single torch--tempted no longer by the decadent and sinister sculptures that
               leered menacingly from the oppressive walls--and which softened our progress to a
               cautious tiptoeing and crawling over the increasingly littered floor and heaps of
               debris.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>
               Danforth's eyes as well as nose proved better than mine, for it was likewise he who first noticed

               and corridors on the ground level. It did not look quite as it ought after countless
               thousands of years of desertion, and when we cautiously turned on more light we saw
               that a kind of swath seemed to have been lately tracked through it. The irregular
               nature of the litter precluded any definite marks, but in the smoother places there
               were suggestions of the dragging of heavy objects. Once we thought there was a hint
               of parallel tracks as if of runners. This was what made us pause again.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>It was during that pause that we caught--simultaneously this time--the other odor
               ahead. Paradoxically, it was both a less frightful and more frightful odor--less frightful
               intrinsically, but infinitely appalling in this place under the known circumstances--unless,
               of course, Gedney--for the odor was the plain and familiar one of common petrol--every-day gasoline.

            <p>But we could not convince each other, or even ourselves, of anything definite. We
               had turned off all light as we stood still, and vaguely noticed that a trace of deeply
               filtered upper day kept the blackness from being absolute. Having automatically begun
               to move ahead, we guided ourselves by occasional flashes from our torch. The disturbed
               debris formed an impression we could not shake off, and the smell of gasoline grew
               stronger. More and more ruin met our eyes and hampered our feet, until very soon we
               saw that the forward way was about to cease. We had been all too correct in our pessimistic
               guess about that rift glimpsed from the air. Our tunnel quest was a blind one, and
               we were not even going to be able to reach the basement out of which the

            <p>The torch, flashing over the

               various states of obstruction; and from one of them the gasoline odor--quite submerging
               that other hint of odor--came with especial distinctness. As we looked more steadily,
               we saw that beyond a doubt there had been a slight and recent clearing away of debris
               from that particular opening. Whatever the lurking horror might be, we believed the
               direct avenue toward it was now plainly manifest. I do not think anyone will wonder
               that we waited an appreciable time before making any further motion.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>And yet, when we did venture inside that black arch, our first impression was one
               of anticlimax. For amidst the littered expanse of that sculptured crypt--a perfect
               cube with sides of about twenty feet--there remained no recent object of instantly
               discernible size; so that we looked instinctively, though in vain, for a farther doorway.
               In another moment, however, Danforth's sharp vision had descried a place where the floor debris had been disturbed; and
               we turned on both torches full strength. Though what we saw in that light was actually
               simple and trifling, I am none the less reluctant to tell of it because of what it
               implied. It was a rough leveling of the debris, upon which several small objects lay
               carelessly scattered, and at one corner of which a considerable amount of gasoline
               must have been spilled lately enough to leave a strong odor even at this extreme superplateau
               altitude. In other words, it could not be other than a sort of camp--a camp made by
               questing beings who, like us, had been turned back by the unexpectedly choked way
               to the

            <p>Let me be plain. The scattered objects were, so far as substance was concerned, all
               from Lake's camp; and consisted of tin cans as 
               <mark class="gothic" title="2">queerly</mark><span class="note"><strong>Synset('queerly.r.01'): </strong>in a strange manner<br /><strong>Synset('queerly.r.02'): </strong>in a questionably unusual manner<br /></span> opened as those we had seen at that ravaged place, many spent matches, three illustrated
               books more or less curiously smudged, an empty ink bottle with its pictorial and instructional
               carton, a broken fountain pen, some oddly snipped fragments of fur and tent cloth,
               a used electric battery with circular of directions, a folder that came with our type
               of tent heater, and a sprinkling of crumpled papers. It was all bad enough but when
               we smoothed out the papers and looked at what was on them, we felt we had come to
               the worst. We had found certain inexplicably blotted papers at the camp which might
               have prepared us, yet the effect of the sight down there in the 
               <mark class="scientific" title="0">prehuman</mark><span class="note"></span> vaults of a nightmare city was almost too much to bear.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>A mad Gedney might have made the groups of dots in imitation of those found on the greenish soapstones,
               just as the dots on those insane five-pointed grave mounds might have been made; and
               he might conceivably have prepared rough, hasty sketches--varying in their accuracy
               or lack of it--which outlined the neighboring parts of the city and traced the way
               from a circularly represented place outside our previous route--a place we identified
               as a great cylindrical tower in the carvings and as a vast circular gulf glimpsed
               in our aerial survey--to the present five-pointed structure and the tunnel mouth therein.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>He might, I repeat, have prepared such sketches; for those before us were quite obviously
               compiled, as our own had been, from late sculptures somewhere in the glacial labyrinth,
               though not from the ones which we had seen and used. But what the art-blind bungler
               could never have done was to execute those sketches in a strange and assured technique
               perhaps superior, despite haste and carelessness, to any of the decadent carvings
               from which they were taken--the characteristic and unmistakable technique of the Old Ones themselves in the dead city's heyday.

               were now--notwithstanding their wildness--completely fixed, and of a nature I need
               not even mention to those who have read my account as far as this. Perhaps we were
               mad--for have I not said those horrible peaks were mountains of madness? But I think
               I can detect something of the same spirit--albeit in a less extreme form--in the men

            <p>Looking back to that moment, I can scarcely recall just what precise form our new
               emotions took--just what change of immediate objective it was that so sharpened our
               sense of expectancy. We certainly did not mean to face what we feared--yet I will
               not deny that we may have had a lurking, unconscious wish to spy certain things from
               some hidden vantage point. Probably we had not given up our zeal to glimpse the

               prodigious round aperture from above. Something about the impressiveness of its rendering,
               even in these hasty diagrams, made us think that its subglacial levels must still
               form a feature of peculiar importance. Perhaps it embodied architectural marvels as
               yet unencountered by us. It was certainly of incredible age according to the sculptures
               in which it figured--being indeed among the first things built in the city. Its carvings,
               if preserved, could not but be highly significant. Moreover, it might form a good
               present link with the upper world--a shorter route than the one we were so carefully
               blazing, and probably that by which those others had descended.

            <p>At any rate, the thing we did was to study the terrible sketches--which quite perfectly
               confirmed our own--and start back over the indicated course to the circular place;
               the course which our nameless predecessors must have traversed twice before us. The

               to leave an economical trail of paper--for it was precisely the same in kind as that
               by which we had reached the cul-de-sac; except that it tended to adhere more closely
               to the ground level and even descend to basement corridors. Every now and then we
               could trace certain disturbing marks in the debris or litter underfoot; and after
               we had passed outside the radius of the gasoline scent, we were again faintly conscious--spasmodically--of
               that more hideous and more persistent scent. After the way had branched from our former
               course, we sometimes gave the rays of our single torch a furtive sweep along the walls;
               noting in almost every case the well-nigh omnipresent sculptures, which indeed seem
               to have formed a main aesthetic outlet for the Old Ones.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>About 9:30 P.M., while traversing a long, vaulted corridor whose increasingly glaciated
               floor seemed somewhat below the ground level and whose roof grew lower as we advanced,
               we began to see strong daylight ahead and were able to turn off our torch. It appeared
               that we were coming to the vast circular place, and that our distance from the upper
               air could not be very great. The corridor ended in an arch surprisingly low for these
               megalithic ruins, but we could see much through it even before we emerged. Beyond
               there stretched a prodigious round space--fully two hundred feet in diameter--strewn
               with debris and containing many choked archways corresponding to the one we were about
               to cross. The walls were--in available spaces--boldly sculptured into a

               here and there, but what we saw seemed inadequate to the function performed. The thing

               up to a height of fully sixty feet. This, we recalled from our aerial survey, meant
               an outside glaciation of some forty feet; since the yawning gulf we had seen from
               the plane had been at the top of an approximately twenty-foot mound of crumbled masonry,
               somewhat sheltered for three-fourths of its circumference by the massive curving walls
               of a line of higher ruins. According to the sculptures, the original tower had stood
               in the center of an immense circular plaza, and had been perhaps five hundred or six
               hundred feet high, with tiers of horizontal disks near the top, and a row of needlelike
               spires along the upper rim. Most of the masonry had obviously toppled outward rather
               than inward--a fortunate happening, since otherwise the ramp might have been shattered
               and the whole interior choked. As it was, the ramp showed sad battering; whilst the
               choking was such that all the archways at the bottom seemed to have been recently
               cleared.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>It took us only a moment to conclude that this was indeed the route by which those
               others had descended, and that this would be the logical route for our own ascent
               despite the long trail of paper we had left elsewhere. The tower's mouth was no farther
               from the foothills and our waiting plane than was the great terraced building we had
               entered, and any further subglacial exploration we might make on this trip would lie
               in this general region. Oddly, we were still thinking about possible later trips--even
               after all we had seen and guessed. Then, as we picked our way cautiously over the
               debris of the great floor, there came a sight which for the time excluded all other
               matters.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>It was the neatly huddled array of three sledges in that farther angle of the ramp's
               lower and outward-projecting course which had hitherto been screened from our view.
               There they were--the three sledges missing from Lake's camp--shaken by a hard usage which must have included forcible dragging along great
               reaches of snowless masonry and debris, as well as much hand portage over utterly
               unnavigable places. They were carefully and intelligently packed and strapped, and
               contained things memorably familiar enough: the gasoline stove, fuel cans, instrument
               cases, provision tins, tarpaulins obviously bulging with books, and some bulging with
               less obvious contents--everything derived from Lake's equipment.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>After what we had found in that other room, we were in a measure prepared for this
               encounter. The really great shock came when we stepped over and undid one tarpaulin
               whose outlines had peculiarly disquieted us. It seems that others as well as Lake had been interested in collecting typical specimens; for there were two here, both
               stiffly frozen, perfectly preserved, patched with adhesive plaster where some wounds
               around the neck had occurred, and wrapped with care to prevent further damage. They
               were the bodies of young Gedney and the missing dog.

               poor Gedney and were standing in a kind of mute bewilderment when the sounds finally reached

               was simply the raucous squawking of a penguin.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>The muffled sound floated from subglacial recesses nearly opposite to the corridor
               whence we had come--regions manifestly in the direction of that other tunnel to the
               vast

               was one of age-long and uniform lifelessness--could lead to only one conclusion; hence
               our first thought was to verify the objective reality of the sound. It was, indeed,
               repeated, and seemed at times to come from more than one throat. Seeking its source,
               we entered an archway from which much debris had been cleared; resuming our trail
               blazing--with an added paper supply taken with curious repugnance from one of the
               tarpaulin bundles on the sledges--when we left daylight behind.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>As the glaciated floor gave place to a litter of detritus, we plainly discerned some
               curious, dragging tracks; and once Danforth found a distinct print of a sort whose description would be only too superfluous.
               The course indicated by the penguin cries was precisely what our map and compass prescribed
               as an approach to the more northerly tunnel mouth, and we were glad to find that a
               bridgeless thoroughfare on the ground and basement levels seemed open. The tunnel,
               according to the chart, ought to start from the basement of a large pyramidal structure
               which we seemed vaguely to recall from our aerial survey as remarkably well-preserved.
               Along our path the single torch showed a customary

            <p>Suddenly a bulky white shape loomed up ahead of us, and we flashed on the second torch.
               It is odd how wholly this new quest had turned our minds from earlier fears of what
               might lurk near. Those other ones, having left their supplies in the great circular
               place, must have planned to return after their scouting trip toward or into the

               never existed. This white, waddling thing was fully six feet high, yet we seemed to
               realize at once that it was not one of those others. They were larger and dark, and,
               according to the sculptures, their motion over land surfaces was a swift, assured
               matter despite the

               came a flash of anticlimax as the white shape sidled into a lateral archway to our

               was only a penguin--albeit of a huge, unknown species larger than the greatest of

            <p>When we had followed the thing into the archway and turned both our torches on the
               indifferent and unheeding group of three, we saw that they were all eyeless albinos

               the same stock--undoubtedly surviving through a retreat to some warmer inner region

               warmth and habitability filled us with the most curious and subtly perturbing fancies.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>We wondered, too, what had caused these three birds to venture out of their usual
               domain. The state and silence of the great dead city made it clear that it had at
               no time been an habitual seasonal rookery, whilst the manifest indifference of the
               trio to our presence made it seem odd that any passing party of those others should
               have startled them. Was it possible that those others had taken some aggressive action
               or tried to increase their meat supply? We doubted whether that

            </p>
            
            
            <p>Not long afterward a steep descent in a long, low, doorless, and peculiarly sculptureless
               corridor led us to believe that we were approaching the tunnel mouth at last. We had
               passed two more penguins, and heard others immediately ahead. Then the corridor ended
               in a prodigious open space which made us gasp involuntarily--a perfect inverted hemisphere,
               obviously deep underground; fully a hundred feet in diameter and fifty feet high,
               with low archways opening around all parts of the circumference but one, and that
               one yawning cavernously with a black, arched aperture which broke the symmetry of
               the vault to a height of nearly fifteen feet. It was the entrance to the great 
               <mark class="gothic" title="2">abyss</mark><span class="note"><strong>Synset('abyss.n.01'): </strong>a bottomless gulf or pit; any unfathomable (or apparently unfathomable) cavity or

            </p>
            
            
            <p>In this vast hemisphere, whose concave roof was impressively though decadently carved
               to a likeness of the

               unseeing. The black tunnel yawned indefinitely off at a steep, descending grade, its
               aperture adorned with 
               <mark class="gothic" title="1">grotesquely</mark><span class="note"><strong>Synset('grotesquely.r.01'): </strong>in a grotesque manner<br /></span> chiseled jambs and lintel. From that

               vapor proceeded; and we wondered what living entities other than penguins the limitless
               void below, and the contiguous honeycombings of the land and the titan mountains,
               might conceal. We wondered, too, whether the trace of mountaintop smoke at first suspected
               by poor Lake, as well as the odd haze we had ourselves perceived around the rampart-crowned peak,
               might not be caused by the tortuous-channeled rising of some such vapor from the unfathomed
               regions of earth's core.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>Entering the tunnel, we saw that its outline was--at least at the start--about fifteen
               feet each way--sides, floor, and arched roof composed of the usual megalithic masonry.
               The sides were sparsely decorated with 
               <mark class="scientific" title="2">cartouches</mark><span class="note"><strong>Synset('cartouche.n.01'): </strong>a cartridge (usually with paper casing)<br /><strong>Synset('cartouche.n.01'): </strong>a cartridge (usually with paper casing)<br /></span> of conventional designs in a late, decadent style; and all the construction and carving
               were marvelously well-preserved. The floor was quite clear, except for a slight detritus
               bearing outgoing penguin tracks and the inward tracks of these others. The farther
               one advanced, the warmer it became; so that we were soon unbuttoning our heavy garments.
               We wondered whether there were any actually igneous manifestations below, and whether
               the waters of that sunless sea were hot. After a short distance the masonry gave place
               to solid rock, though the tunnel kept the same proportions and presented the same
               aspect of carved regularity. Occasionally its varying grade became so steep that grooves
               were cut in the floor. Several times we noted the mouths of small lateral galleries
               not recorded in our diagrams; none of them such as to complicate the problem of our
               return, and all of them welcome as possible refuges in case we met unwelcome entities
               on their way back from the

               foolish to venture into that tunnel under the known conditions, but the lure of the
               unplumbed is stronger in certain persons than most suspect--indeed, it was just such
               a lure which had brought us to this

We saw several penguins as we passed along, and speculated
               on the distance we would have to traverse. The carvings had led us to expect a steep
               downhill walk of about a mile to the 
               <mark class="gothic" title="2">abyss</mark><span class="note"><strong>Synset('abyss.n.01'): </strong>a bottomless gulf or pit; any unfathomable (or apparently unfathomable) cavity or

               be depended on.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>After about a quarter of a mile that nameless scent became greatly accentuated, and
               we kept very careful track of the various lateral openings we passed. There was no
               visible vapor as at the mouth, but this was doubtless due to the lack of contrasting
               cooler air. The temperature was rapidly ascending, and we were not surprised to come
               upon a careless heap of material shudderingly familiar to us. It was composed of furs
               and tent cloth taken from Lake's camp, and we did not pause to study the

The nameless scent
               was now curiously mixed with another and scarcely less offensive odor--of what nature
               we could not guess, though we thought of

Then came a startling expansion
               of the tunnel for which the carvings had not prepared us--a broadening and rising
               into a lofty, natural-looking elliptical cavern with a level floor, some seventy-five
               feet long and fifty broad, and with many immense side passages leading away into

            </p>
            
            
            <p>Though this cavern was natural in appearance, an inspection with both torches suggested
               that it had been formed by the artificial destruction of several walls between adjacent
               honeycombings. The walls were rough, and the high, vaulted roof was thick with stalactites;
               but the solid rock floor had been smoothed off, and was free from all debris, detritus,
               or even dust to a positively

Except for the avenue through which we had come, this was true of the floors
               of all the great galleries opening off from it; and the singularity of the condition
               was such as to set us vainly puzzling. The curious new fetor which had supplemented
               the nameless scent was excessively

            </p>
            
            
            <p>The regularity of the passage immediately ahead, as well as the larger proportion
               of penguin-droppings there, prevented all confusion as to the right course amidst
               this plethora of equally great cave mouths. Nevertheless we resolved to resume our
               paper trailblazing if any further complexity should develop; for dust tracks, of course,
               could no longer be expected. Upon resuming our direct progress we cast a beam of torchlight
               over the tunnel walls--and stopped short in amazement at the supremely radical change
               which had come over the carvings in this part of the passage. We realized, of course,
               the great decadence of the Old Ones' sculpture at the time of the tunneling, and had indeed noticed the inferior workmanship
               of the

               was a sudden difference wholly transcending explanation--a difference in basic nature
               as well as in mere quality, and involving so profound and calamitous a degradation
               of skill that nothing in the hitherto observed rate of decline could have led one

            <p>Since we could not afford to spend any considerable time in study, we resumed our
               advance after a cursory look; though frequently casting beams over the walls to see
               if any further decorative changes developed. Nothing of the sort was perceived, though
               the carvings were in places rather sparse because of the numerous mouths of smooth-floored
               lateral tunnels. We saw and heard fewer penguins, but thought we caught a vague suspicion
               of an infinitely distant chorus of them somewhere deep within the earth. The new and
               inexplicable odor was abominably strong, and we could detect scarcely a sign of that
               other nameless scent. Puffs of visible vapor ahead bespoke increasing contrasts in
               temperature, and the relative nearness of the sunless sea cliffs of the great

               which were quite definitely not penguins--and turned on our second torch after making
               sure that the objects were quite stationary.

            <p>Still another time have I come to a place where it is very difficult to proceed. I
               ought to be hardened by this stage; but there are some experiences and intimations
               which scar too deeply to permit of healing, and leave only such an added sensitiveness
               that memory reinspires all the original horror. We saw, as I have said, certain obstructions
               on the polished floor ahead; and I may add that our nostrils were assailed almost
               simultaneously by a very curious intensification of the strange prevailing fetor,
               now quite plainly mixed with the nameless stench of those others which had gone before.
               The light of the second torch left no doubt of what the obstructions were, and we
               dared approach them only because we could see, even from a distance, that they were
               quite as past all harming power as had been the six similar specimens

               their incompleteness was of infinitely greater recency. There seemed to be only four
               of them, whereas Lake's bulletins would have suggested no less than eight as forming the group which had
               preceded us. To find them in this state was wholly unexpected, and we wondered what
               sort of

            <p>Penguins, attacked in a body, retaliate savagely with their beaks, and our ears now
               made certain the existence of a rookery far beyond. Had those others disturbed such
               a place and aroused murderous pursuit? The obstructions did not suggest it, for penguins'
               beaks against the tough tissues Lake had dissected could hardly account for the terrible damage our approaching glance
               was beginning to make out. Besides, the huge blind birds we had seen appeared to be
               singularly peaceful.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>Had there, then, been a struggle among those others, and were the absent four responsible?
               If so, where were they? Were they close at hand and likely to form an immediate menace
               to us? We glanced anxiously at some of the smooth-floored lateral passages as we continued
               our slow and frankly reluctant approach. Whatever the conflict was, it had clearly
               been that which had frightened the penguins into their unaccustomed wandering. It
               must, then, have arisen near that faintly heard rookery in the incalculable gulf beyond,
               since there were no signs that any birds had normally dwelt here. Perhaps, we reflected,
               there had been a hideous running fight, with the weaker party seeking to get back
               to the cached sledges when their pursuers finished them. One could picture the

            <p>The new sound, as I have intimated, upset much that we had decided; because it was
               what poor Lake's dissection had led us to attribute to those we had judged dead. It was, Danforth later told me, precisely what he had caught in infinitely muffled form when at that
               spot beyond the alley corner above the glacial level; and it certainly had a shocking
               resemblance to the wind pipings we had both heard around the lofty mountain caves.
               At the risk of seeming puerile I will add another thing, too, if only because of the
               surprising way Danforth's impressions chimed with mine. Of course common reading is what prepared us both to

            <p>We were in full flight before three notes or syllables had been uttered, though we
               knew that the swiftness of the Old Ones would enable any scream-roused and pursuing survivor of the slaughter to overtake
               us in a moment if it really wished to do so. We had a vague hope, however, that nonaggressive
               conduct and a display of kindred reason might cause such a being to spare us in case
               of capture, if only from scientific curiosity. After all, if such an one had nothing
               to fear for itself, it would have no motive in harming us. Concealment being futile
               at this juncture, we used our torch for a running glance behind, and perceived that
               the mist was thinning. Would we see, at last, a complete and living specimen of those
               others? Again came that insidious musical piping--<q>"Tekeli-li! Tekeli-li!"</q> Then, noting that we were actually gaining on our pursuer, it occurred to us that
               the entity might be wounded. We could take no chances, however, since it was very
               obviously approaching in answer to Danforth's scream, rather than in flight from any other entity. The timing was too close to
               admit of doubt. Of the whereabouts of that less conceivable and less mentionable nightmare--that

               automatic attempt to answer a subconscious question raised by one of our senses. In
               the midst of our flight, with all our faculties centered on the problem of escape,

               In the neighborhood of the prostrate things that new and lately unexplainable fetor
               had been wholly dominant; but by this time it ought to have largely given place to
               the nameless stench associated with those others. This it had not done--for instead,

            <p>So we glanced back simultaneously, it would appear; though no doubt the incipient
               motion of one prompted the imitation of the other. As we did so we flashed both torches
               full strength at the momentarily thinned mist; either from sheer primitive anxiety
               to see all we could, or in a less primitive but equally unconscious effort to dazzle
               the entity before we dimmed our light and dodged among the penguins of the labyrinth
               center ahead. Unhappy act! Not Orpheus himself, or Lot's wife, paid much more dearly
               for a backward glance. And again came that shocking, wide-ranged piping--<q>"Tekeli-li! Tekeli-li!"</q>

            <p>I might as well be frank--even if I cannot bear to be quite direct--in stating what
               we saw; though at the time we felt that it was not to be admitted even to each other.
               The words reaching the reader can never even suggest the awfulness of the sight itself.
               It crippled our consciousness so completely that I wonder we had the residual sense
               to dim our torches as planned, and to strike the right tunnel toward the dead city.
               Instinct alone must have carried us through--perhaps better than reason could have
               done; though if that was what saved us, we paid a high price. Of reason we certainly
               had little enough left.

               Danforth was totally unstrung, and the first thing I remember of the rest of the journey was
               hearing him lightheadedly chant an hysterical formula in which I alone of mankind
               could have found anything but insane irrelevance. It reverberated in falsetto echoes
               among the squawks of the penguins; reverberated through the vaultings ahead, and--thank
               God--through the now empty vaultings behind. He could not have begun it at once--else
               we would not have been alive and blindly racing. I shudder to think of what a shade
               of difference in his nervous reactions might have brought.

            <p>Yet long before we had passed the great star-shaped ruin and reached our plane, our
               fears had become transferred to the lesser but vast-enough range whose recrossing
               lay ahead of us. From these foothills the black, ruin-crusted slopes reared up starkly
               and hideously against the east, again reminding us of those strange Asian paintings
               of Nicholas Roerich
               ; and when we thought of the frightful amorphous entities that might have pushed their
               
               <mark class="gothic" title="0">fetidly</mark><span class="note"></span> squirming way even to the topmost hollow pinnacles, we could not face without panic
               the prospect of again sailing by those suggestive skyward cave mouths where the wind
               made sounds like an evil musical piping over a wide range. To make matters worse,
               we saw distinct traces of local mist around several of the summits--as poor Lake must have done when he made that early mistake about volcanism--and thought shiveringly
               of that kindred mist from which we had just escaped; of that, and of the

            <p>All was well with the plane, and we clumsily hauled on our heavy flying furs. Danforth got the engine started without trouble, and we made a very smooth take-off over the
               nightmare city. Below us the

               to test the wind for our crossing through the pass. At a very high level there must
               have been great disturbance, since the ice-dust clouds of the zenith were doing all
               sorts of fantastic things; but at twenty-four thousand feet, the height we needed
               for the pass, we found navigation quite practicable. As we drew close to the jutting
               peaks the wind's strange piping again became manifest, and I could see Danforth's hands trembling at the controls. Rank amateur that I was, I thought at that moment
               that I might be a better navigator than he in effecting the dangerous crossing between
               pinnacles; and when I made motions to change seats and take over his duties he did
               not protest. I tried to keep all my skill and self-possession about me, and stared
               at the sector of reddish farther sky betwixt the walls of the pass--resolutely refusing
               to pay attention to the puffs of mountain-top vapor, and wishing that I had wax-stopped
               ears like Ulysses' men off the Siren's coast to keep that disturbing windpiping from my consciousness.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>But Danforth, released from his piloting and keyed up to a dangerous nervous pitch, could not
               keep quiet. I felt him turning and wriggling about as he looked back at the terrible
               receding city, ahead at the cave-riddled, cube-barnacled peaks, sidewise at the bleak
               sea of snowy, rampart-strewn foothills, and upward at the seething, 
               <mark class="gothic" title="1">grotesquely</mark><span class="note"><strong>Synset('grotesquely.r.01'): </strong>in a grotesque manner<br /></span> clouded sky. It was then, just as I was trying to steer safely through the pass,
               that his mad shrieking brought us so close to disaster by shattering my tight hold
               on myself and causing me to fumble helplessly with the controls for a moment. A second
               afterward my resolution triumphed and we made the crossing safely--yet I am afraid
               that Danforth will never be the same again.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>I have said that Danforth refused to tell me what final horror made him scream out so insanely--a horror which,
               I feel sadly sure, is mainly responsible for his present breakdown. We had snatches
               of shouted conversation above the wind's piping and the engine's buzzing as we reached
               the safe side of the range and swooped slowly down toward the camp, but that had mostly
               to do with the pledges of secrecy we had made as we prepared to leave the nightmare
               city. Certain things, we had agreed, were not for people to know and discuss lightly--and
               I would not speak of them now but for the need of heading off that Starkweather-Moore Expedition, and others, at any cost. It is absolutely necessary, for the peace and safety of
               mankind, that some of earth's dark, dead corners and unplumbed depths be let alone;

            <p>All that Danforth has ever hinted is that the final horror was a mirage. It was not, he declares, anything
               connected with the cubes and caves of those echoing, vaporous, wormily-honeycombed
               mountains of madness which we crossed; but a single fantastic,

               westward mountains which the Old Ones had shunned and feared. It is very probable that the thing was a sheer delusion born
               of the previous stresses we had passed through, and of the actual though unrecognized
               mirage of the dead transmontane city experienced near Lake's camp the day before; but it was so real to Danforth that he suffers from it still.

               sometimes be reflected, refracted, and magnified by such layers of restless cloud,
               might easily have supplied the rest--and, of course, Danforth did not hint any of these specific horrors till after his memory had had a chance
