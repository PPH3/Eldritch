	H.P. Lovecraft’s work differs from that of his contemporaries. His worldview held that humankind is a tragic cosmic accident that is mocked by an ancient race of extraterrestrial gods known as “The Great Old Ones.” Among these beings are: Cthulhlu, Nyarlathotep, and Yog-Sothoth. The tales involving these deities are replete with madness, horror, and bizarre mutations. The Great Old One’s hold humankind with utter indifference, with the exception of the select few who are sensitive to the powers of The Great Old Ones and wish to resurrect them from the darkest regions of the space. 
	This is facilitated by delving into the horrid word of Lovecraft’s forbidden grimoire, The Necronomicon. The author has cast many character who thirst for knowledge and seek to uncover esoteric secrets. These damned figures unleash a bevy of horrors upon an unsuspecting New England. The protagonists of these tales are subjected to atrocities wrought by an unforgiving cosmos and as a result, they go irretrievably insane. 
	The prose of Lovecraft is what distinguishes him from other writers of speculative fiction. His verbose style is laden with exotic adjectives and archaic references, which serve to confound the average reader as Lovecraft wrote pedantically and not to the comprehension level of his readership. 
	The goal of the Eldritch project is to delve into three works of Lovecraft: “The Call of Cthulhu,” “The Shadow Over Innsmouth,” and “At the Mountains of Madness.” These pieces are exemplary of Lovecraft’s style: verbose prose with an affinity for extravagant descriptions. We have isolated these words and researched their meanings and their usages over time and how it changed.
