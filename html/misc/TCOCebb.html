               <h2>I.The Horror in Clay.</h2>
               
               <p>The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind
                  to correlate all its contents. We live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst
                  of black seas of infinity, and it was not meant that we should voyage far. The sciences,
                  each straining in its own direction, have hitherto harmed us little; but some day
                  the piecing together of dissociated knowledge will open up such terrifying vistas
                  of reality, and of our frightful position therein, that we shall either go mad from
                  the revelation or flee from the deadly light into the peace and safety of a new dark
                  age.
               </p>
               
               <p>
                  
                  <mark class="scientific" title="1">Theosophists</mark><span class="note"><strong>Synset('theosophist.n.01'): </strong>a believer in theosophy<br /></span> have guessed at the awesome grandeur of the cosmic cycle wherein our world and human
                  race form transient incidents. They have hinted at strange survivals in terms which
                  would freeze the blood if not masked by a bland optimism. But it is not from them
                  that there came the single glimpse of forbidden aeons which chills me when I think
                  of it and maddens me when I dream of it. That glimpse, like all dread glimpses of
                  truth, flashed out from an accidental piecing together of separated things—in this
                  case an old newspaper item and the notes of a dead professor. I hope that no one else
                  will accomplish this piecing out; certainly, if I live, I shall never knowingly supply
                  a link in so hideous a chain. I think that the professor, too, intended to keep silent
                  regarding the part he knew, and that he would have destroyed his notes had not sudden
                  death seized him.
               </p>
               
               <p>My Knowledge of the thing began in the winter of 1926–27 with the death of my grand-uncle George Gammell Angell, Professor Emeritus of Semitic Languages in Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island. Professor Angell was widely known as an authority on

                  so that his passing at the age of ninety-two may be recalled by many. Locally, interest
                  was intensified by the obscurity of the cause of death. The professor had been stricken
                  whilst returning from the Newport boat; falling suddenly, as witnesses said, after
                  having been jostled by a nautical-looking negro who had come from one of the queer
                  dark courts on the precipitous hillside which formed a short cut from the waterfront
                  to the deceased's home in Williams Street. Physicians were unable to find any visible disorder, but concluded after perplexed
                  debate that some obscure lesion of the heart, induced by the brisk ascent of so steep
                  a hill by so elderly a man, was responsible for the end. At the time I saw no reason
                  to dissent from this dictum, but latterly I am inclined to wonder—and more than wonder.
               </p>
               
               
               <p>As my grand-uncle's heir and executor, for he died a childless widower, I was expected
                  to go over his papers with some thoroughness; and for that purpose moved his entire
                  set of files and boxes to my quarters in Boston. Much of the material which I correlated will be later published by the American Archaeological Society, but there was one box which I found exceedingly puzzling, and which I felt much
                  averse from

                     experiment<br /></span> to other eyes. It had been locked, and I did not find the key till it occurred to
                  me to examine the personal ring which the professor carried always in his pocket.
                  Then indeed I succeeded in opening it, but when I did so seemed only to be confronted
                  by a greater and more closely locked barrier. For what could be the meaning of the
                  queer clay bas-relief and the disjointed jottings, ramblings, and cuttings which I
                  found? Had my uncle, in his latter years, become credulous of the most superficial
                  impostures? I resolved to search out the eccentric sculptor responsible for this apparent
                  disturbance of an old man's peace of mind.
               </p>
               
               <p>The bas-relief was a rough rectangle less than an inch thick and about five by six
                  inches in area; obviously of modern origin. Its designs, however, were far from modern
                  in atmosphere and suggestion; for although the vagaries of cubism and futurism are
                  many and wild, they do not often reproduce that cryptic regularity which lurks in
                  prehistoric writing. And writing of some kind the bulk of these designs seemed certainly
                  to be; though my memory, despite much familiarity with the papers and collections
                  of my uncle, failed in any way to identify this particular species, or even to hint
                  at its remotest affiliations.
               </p>
               
               <p>Above these apparent hieroglyphics was a figure of evidently pictorial intent, though
                  its impressionistic execution forbade a very clear idea of its nature. It seemed to
                  be a sort of monster, or symbol representing a monster, of a form which only a diseased
                  fancy could conceive. If I say that my somewhat extravagant imagination yielded simultaneous
                  pictures of an octopus, a dragon, and a human caricature, I shall not be unfaithful
                  to the spirit of the thing. A

                  which made it most shockingly frightful. Behind the figure was a vague suggestion

               </p>
               
               <p>The writing accompanying this oddity was, aside from a stack of press cuttings, in
                  Professor Angell's most recent hand; and made no pretence to literary style. What seemed to be the main
                  document was headed “CTHULHU CULT” in characters painstakingly printed to avoid the erroneous reading of a word so unheard-of.
                  The manuscript was divided into two sections, the first of which was headed “1925—Dream
                  and Dream Work of H. A. Wilcox, 7 Thomas St., Providence, R.I.”, and the second, “Narrative of Inspector John R. Legrasse, 121 Bienville St., New Orleans, La., at 1908 A. A. S. Mtg.—Notes on Same, @amp Prof. Webb's Acct.” The other manuscript papers were all brief notes, some of them accounts of
                  the queer dreams of different persons, some of them citations from theosophical books
                  and magazines (notably W. Scott-Elliot's Atlantis and the Lost Lemuria), and the rest comments on long-surviving secret societies and hidden s, with references
                  to passages in such

                  or mania in the spring of 1925.
               </p>
               
               <p>The first half of the principal manuscript told a very peculiar tale. It appears that
                  on March 1st, 1925, a thin, dark young man of neurotic and excited aspect had called upon Professor Angell bearing the singular clay bas-relief, which was then exceedingly damp and fresh.
                  His card bore the name of Henry Anthony Wilcox, and my uncle had recognised him as the youngest son of an excellent family slightly
                  known to him, who had latterly been studying sculpture at the Rhode Island School
                  of Design and living alone at the Fleur-de-Lys Building near that institution. Wilcox was a precocious youth of known genius but great eccentricity, and had from childhood
                  excited attention through the strange stories and odd dreams he was in the habit of
                  relating. He called himself <q>“

               <p>On the occasion of the visit, ran the professor's manuscript, the sculptor abruptly
                  asked for the benefit of his host's archaeological knowledge in identifying the hieroglyphics
                  on the bas-relief. He spoke in a dreamy, stilted manner which suggested pose and

                  of the tablet implied kinship with anything but archaeology. Young 
                  Wilcox's rejoinder, which impressed my uncle enough to make him recall and record it verbatim,
                  was of a fantastically poetic cast which must have typified his whole conversation,
                  and which I have since found highly characteristic of him. He said, <q>“It is new, indeed, for I made it last night in a dream of strange cities; and dreams
                     are older than brooding Tyre, or the contemplative Sphinx, or garden-girdled Babylon.”</q>
                  
               </p>
               
               <p>It was then that he began that rambling tale which suddenly played upon a sleeping
                  memory and won the fevered interest of my uncle. There had been a slight earthquake
                  tremor the night before, the most considerable felt in New England for some years;
                  and Wilcox's imagination had been keenly affected. Upon retiring, he had had an unprecedented
                  dream of great 
                  <mark class="scientific" title="1">Cyclopean</mark><span class="note"><strong>Synset('cyclopean.a.01'): </strong>of or relating to or resembling the Cyclops<br /></span> cities of titan blocks and sky-flung monoliths, all dripping with green ooze and
                  sinister with latent horror. Hieroglyphics had covered the walls and pillars, and
                  from some undetermined point below had come a voice that was not a voice; a chaotic
                  sensation which only fancy could transmute into sound, but which he attempted to render
                  by the almost unpronounceable jumble of letters,<q>“Cthulhu fhtagn”</q>.
               </p>
               
               <p>This verbal jumble was the key to the recollection which excited and disturbed Professor Angell. He questioned the sculptor with scientific minuteness; and studied with almost frantic
                  intensity the bas-relief on which the youth had found himself working, chilled and
                  clad only in his night-clothes, when waking had stolen bewilderingly over him. My
                  uncle blamed his old age, Wilcox afterward said, for his slowness in recognising both hieroglyphics and pictorial
                  design. Many of his questions seemed highly out-of-place to his visitor, especially
                  those which tried to connect the latter with strange s or societies; and Wilcox could not understand the repeated promises of silence which he was offered in exchange
                  for an admission of membership in some widespread

                  lore, he besieged his visitor with demands for future reports of dreams. This bore
                  regular fruit, for after the first interview the manuscript records daily calls of

               <p>On March 23d, the manuscript continued, Wilcox failed to appear; and inquiries at his quarters revealed that he had been stricken
                  with an obscure sort of fever and taken to the home of his family in Waterman Street.
                  He had cried out in the night, arousing several other artists in the building, and
                  had manifested since then only alternations of unconsciousness and delirium. My uncle
                  at once telephoned the family, and from that time forward kept close watch of the
                  case; calling often at the Thayer Street office of Dr. Tobey, whom he learned to be in charge. The youth's 
                  <mark class="scientific" title="1">febrile</mark><span class="note"><strong>Synset('febrile.a.01'): </strong>of or relating to or characterized by fever<br /></span> mind, apparently, was dwelling on strange things; and the doctor shuddered now and
                  then as he spoke of them. They included not only a repetition of what he had formerly
                  dreamed, but touched wildly on a gigantic thing <q>“miles high”</q> which walked or lumbered about. He at no time fully described this object, but occasional
                  frantic words, as repeated by Dr. Tobey, convinced the professor that it must be identical with the nameless monstrosity
                  he had sought to depict in his dream-sculpture. Reference to this object, the doctor
                  added, was invariably a prelude to the young man's subsidence into lethargy. His temperature,
                  oddly enough, was not greatly above normal; but his whole condition was otherwise
                  such as to suggest true fever rather than mental disorder.
               </p>
               
               <p>On April 2nd at about 3 p.m. every trace of Wilcox's malady suddenly ceased. He sat upright in bed, astonished to find himself at home
                  and completely ignorant of what had happened in dream or reality since the night of
                  March 22nd. Pronounced well by his physician, he returned to his quarters in three days; but
                  to Professor Angell he was of no further assistance. All traces of strange dreaming
                  had vanished with his recovery, and my uncle kept no record of his night-thoughts
                  after a week of pointless and irrelevant accounts of thoroughly usual visions.
               </p>
               
               <p>Here the first part of the manuscript ended, but references to certain of the scattered
                  notes gave me much material for thought—so much, in fact, that only the ingrained
                  scepticism then forming my philosophy can account for my continued distrust of the
                  artist. The notes in question were those descriptive of the dreams of various persons
                  covering the same period as that in which young Wilcox had had his strange visitations. My uncle, it seems, had quickly instituted a prodigiously
                  far-flung body of inquiries amongst nearly all the friends whom he could question
                  without impertinence, asking for nightly reports of their dreams, and the dates of
                  any notable visions for some time past. The reception of his request seems to have
                  been varied; but he must, at the very least, have received more responses than any
                  ordinary man could have handled without a secretary. This original correspondence
                  was not preserved, but his notes formed a thorough and really significant digest.
                  Average people in society and business—New England's traditional <q>“salt of the earth”</q>—gave an almost completely negative result, though scattered cases of uneasy but formless
                  nocturnal impressions appear here and there, always between March 23d and April 2nd—the period of young 
                  Wilcox's delirium. Scientific men were little more affected, though four cases of vague description
                  suggest fugitive glimpses of strange landscapes, and in one case there is mentioned
                  a dread of something

               <p>It was from the artists and poets that the pertinent answers came, and I know that
                  panic would have broken loose had they been able to compare notes. As it was, lacking
                  their original letters, I half suspected the compiler of having asked leading questions,
                  or of having edited the correspondence in corroboration of what he had latently resolved
                  to see. That is why I continued to feel that Wilcox, somehow cognisant of the old data which my uncle had possessed, had been imposing
                  on the veteran scientist. These responses from aesthetes told a disturbing tale. From
                  February 28th to April 2nd a large proportion of them had dreamed very 
                  <mark class="other" title="1">bizarre</mark><span class="note"><strong>Synset('bizarre.s.01'): </strong>conspicuously or grossly unconventional or unusual<br /></span> things, the intensity of the dreams being immeasurably the stronger during the period
                  of the sculptor's delirium. Over a fourth of those who reported anything, reported
                  scenes and half-sounds not unlike those which Wilcox had described; and some of the dreamers confessed acute fear of the gigantic nameless
                  thing visible toward the last. One case, which the note describes with emphasis, was
                  very sad. The subject, a widely known architect with leanings toward theosophy and
                  ocism, went violently insane on the date of young Wilcox's seizure, and expired several months later after incessant screamings to be saved
                  from some escaped denizen of

Had my uncle referred to these cases by name instead of merely by number, I should
                  have attempted some corroboration and personal investigation; but as it was, I succeeded
                  in tracing down only a few. All of these, however, bore out the notes in full. I have
                  often wondered if all the objects of the professor's questioning felt as puzzled as
                  did this fraction. It is well that no explanation shall ever reach them.

               <p>The press cuttings, as I have intimated, touched on cases of panic, mania, and eccentricity
                  during the given period. Professor Angell must have employed a cutting bureau, for the number of extracts was tremendous and
                  the sources scattered throughout the globe. Here was a nocturnal suicide in London,
                  where a lone sleeper had leaped from a window after a shocking cry. Here likewise

                  a dire future from visions he has seen. A despatch from California describes a

                  by hysterical Levantines on the night of March 22–23. The west of Ireland, too, is full of wild rumour and

                  envisage the callous rationalism with which I set them aside. But I was then convinced
                  that young Wilcox had known of the older matters mentioned by the professor.

               <p>The older matters which had made the sculptor's dream and bas-relief so significant
                  to my uncle formed the subject of the second half of his long manuscript. Once before,
                  it appears, Professor Angell had seen the

                  heard the ominous syllables which can be rendered only as <q>“Cthulhu”</q>; and all this in so stirring and horrible a connexion that it is small wonder he
                  pursued young Wilcox with queries and demands for data.
                  
               </p>
               
               <p>The earlier experience had come in 1908, seventeen years before, when the American Archaeological Society held its annual
                  meeting in St. Louis. Professor Angell, as befitted one of his authority and attainments, had had a prominent part in all
                  the deliberations; and was one of the first to be approached by the several outsiders
                  who took advantage of the convocation to offer questions for correct answering and
                  problems for expert solution.
                  
               </p>
               
               <p>The chief of these outsiders, and in a short time the focus of interest for the entire
                  meeting, was a commonplace-looking middle-aged man who had travelled all the way from
                  New Orleans for certain special information unobtainable from any local source. His name was
                  John Raymond Legrasse, and he was by profession an Inspector of Police. With him he bore the subject of
                  his visit, a

                  rites connected with it, that the police could not but realise that they had stumbled
                  on a dark  totally unknown to them, and infinitely more diabolic than even the blackest of the
                  African voodoo circles. Of its origin, apart from the erratic and unbelievable tales
                  extorted from the captured members, absolutely nothing was to be discovered; hence
                  the anxiety of the police for any antiquarian lore which might help them to place
                  the frightful symbol, and through it track down the  to its fountain-head.

               <p>
                  Inspector Legrasse was scarcely prepared for the sensation which his offering created. One sight of
                  the thing had been enough to throw the assembled men of science into a state of tense
                  excitement, and they lost no time in crowding around him to gaze at the diminutive
                  figure whose utter strangeness and air of genuinely abysmal antiquity hinted so potently
                  at unopened and archaic vistas. No recognised school of sculpture had animated this
                  terrible object, yet centuries and even thousands of years seemed recorded in its
                  dim and greenish surface of unplaceable stone.
                  
               </p>
               
               <p>The figure, which was finally passed slowly from man to man for close and careful
                  study, was between seven and eight inches in height, and of exquisitely artistic workmanship.
                  It represented a monster of vaguely

                  rubbery-looking body, prodigious claws on hind and fore feet, and long, narrow wings
                  behind. This thing, which seemed instinct with a fearsome and unnatural malignancy,
                  was of a somewhat bloated corpulence, and squatted evilly on a rectangular block or
                  pedestal covered with undecipherable characters. The tips of the wings touched the
                  back edge of the block, the seat occupied the centre, whilst the long, curved claws
                  of the doubled-up, crouching hind legs gripped the front edge and extended a quarter
                  of the way down toward the bottom of the pedestal. The cephalopod head was bent forward,
                  so that the ends of the facial feelers brushed the backs of huge fore paws which clasped
                  the croucher's elevated knees. The aspect of the whole was

                  shew with any known type of art belonging to civilisation's youth—or indeed to any

                  linguistic kinship. They, like the subject and material, belonged to something horribly
                  remote and distinct from mankind as we know it; something frightfully suggestive of

               <p>
                  Legrasse had one point in advance of Professor Webb, for several among his mongrel prisoners
                  had repeated to him what older celebrants had told them the words meant. This text,
                  as given, ran something like this:“

               <p>And now, in response to a general and urgent demand, Inspector Legrasse related as fully as possible his experience with the swamp worshippers; telling a
                  story to which I could see my uncle attached profound significance. It savoured of
                  the wildest dreams of

               </p>
               
               <p>On November 1st, 1907, there had come to the New Orleans police a frantic summons from the swamp and lagoon country to the south. The squatters
                  there, mostly primitive but good-natured descendants of Lafitte's men, were in the grip of stark terror from an unknown thing which had stolen upon
                  them in the night. It was voodoo, apparently, but voodoo of a more terrible sort than
                  they had ever known; and some of their women and children had disappeared since the
                  malevolent tom-tom had begun its incessant beating far within the black haunted woods
                  where no dweller ventured. There were insane shouts and harrowing screams, soul-chilling
                  chants and dancing devil-flames; and, the frightened messenger added, the people could
                  stand it no more.
                  
               </p>
               
               <p>So a body of twenty police, filling two carriages and an automobile, had set out in
                  the late afternoon with the shivering squatter as a guide. At the end of the passable
                  road they alighted, and for miles splashed on in silence through the terrible cypress
                  woods where day never came. Ugly roots and

                     (especially of a tumor)<br /></span> hanging nooses of Spanish moss beset them, and now and then a pile of dank stones
                  or fragment of a rotting wall intensified by its hint of morbid habitation a depression
                  which every malformed tree and every fungous islet combined to create. At length the
                  squatter settlement, a miserable huddle of huts, hove in sight; and hysterical dwellers
                  ran out to cluster around the group of bobbing lanterns. The muffled beat of tom-toms
                  was now faintly audible far, far ahead; and a curdling shriek came at infrequent intervals
                  when the wind shifted. A reddish glare, too, seemed to filter through the pale undergrowth
                  beyond endless avenues of forest night. Reluctant even to be left alone again, each
                  one of the cowed squatters refused point-blank to advance another inch toward the
                  scene of unholy worship, so Inspector Legrasse and his nineteen colleagues plunged on unguided into black arcades of horror that
                  none of them had ever trod before.
                  
               </p>
               
               <p>The region now entered by the police was one of traditionally evil repute, substantially
                  unknown and untraversed by white men. There were

                  made men dream, and so they knew enough to keep away. The present voodoo orgy was,
                  indeed, on the merest fringe of this abhorred area, but that location was bad enough;
                  hence perhaps the very place of the worship had terrified the squatters more than
                  the shocking sounds and incidents.
                  
               </p>
               
               <p>Only poetry or madness could do justice to the noises heard by Legrasse's men as they ploughed on through the black morass toward the red glare and the muffled

Now and then the less organised ululation would cease, and from what seemed a well-drilled
                  chorus of hoarse voices would rise in sing-song chant that hideous phrase or ritual:
                  “

               <p>Then the men, having reached a spot where the trees were thinner, came suddenly in
                  sight of the spectacle itself. Four of them reeled, one fainted, and two were shaken
                  into a frantic cry which the mad cacophony of the orgy fortunately deadened. Legrasse dashed swamp water on the face of the fainting man, and all stood trembling and nearly

                  the remotest trees—but I suppose he had been hearing too much native superstition.

               <p>Actually, the horrified pause of the men was of comparatively brief duration. Duty
                  came first; and although there must have been nearly a hundred mongrel celebrants
                  in the throng, the police relied on their firearms and plunged determinedly into the
                  nauseous rout. For five minutes the resultant din and chaos were beyond description.
                  Wild blows were struck, shots were fired, and escapes were made; but in the end Legrasse
                  was able to count some forty-seven sullen prisoners, whom he forced to dress in haste
                  and fall into line between two rows of policemen. Five of the worshippers lay dead,
                  and two severely wounded ones were carried away on improvised stretchers by their
                  fellow-prisoners. The image on the monolith, of course, was carefully removed and
                  carried back by Legrasse.

               <p>Examined at headquarters after a trip of intense strain and weariness, the prisoners
                  all proved to be men of a very low, mixed-blooded, and mentally aberrant type. Most

                  Portuguese from the Cape Verde Islands, gave a colouring of voodooism to the heterogeneous . But before many questions were

                  dead bodies had told their secrets in dreams to the first men, who formed a  which
                  had never died. This was that , and the prisoners said it had always existed and always
                  would exist, hidden in distant wastes and dark places all over the world until the
                  time when the great priest Cthulhu, from his dark house in the mighty city of R'lyeh under the waters, should rise and bring the earth again beneath his sway. Some day
                  he would call, when the stars were ready, and the secret  would always be waiting

               <p>These Great Old Ones, Castro continued, were not composed altogether of flesh and blood. They had shape—for did
                  not this star-fashioned image prove it?—but that shape was not made of matter. When
                  the stars were right, They could plunge from world to world through the sky; but when
                  the stars were wrong, They could not live. But although They no longer lived, They
                  would never really die. They all lay in stone houses in Their great city of R'lyeh, preserved by the spells of mighty Cthulhu for a glorious resurrection when the stars and the earth might once more be ready
                  for Them. But at that time some force from outside must serve to liberate Their bodies.
                  The spells that preserved Them intact likewise prevented Them from making an initial
                  move, and They could only lie awake in the dark and think whilst uncounted millions
                  of years rolled by. They knew all that was occurring in the universe, but Their mode
                  of speech was transmitted thought. Even now They talked in Their tombs. When, after
                  infinities of chaos, the first men came, the Great Old Ones spoke to the sensitive among them by moulding their dreams; for only thus could Their
                  language reach the fleshly minds of mammals.

                  had sunk beneath the waves; and the deep waters, full of the one primal

But memory never died, and high-priests said that the city would rise
                  again when the stars were right. Then came out of the earth the black spirits of earth,
                  mouldy and shadowy, and full of dim rumours picked up in caverns beneath forgotten
                  sea-bottoms. But of them old Castro dared not speak much. He cut himself off hurriedly,
                  and no amount of persuasion or subtlety could elicit more in this direction. The size
                  of the Old Ones, too, he curiously declined to mention. Of the , he said that he thought the centre
                  lay amid the pathless deserts of Arabia, where Irem, the City of Pillars, dreams hidden
                  and untouched. It was not allied to the European witch-, and was virtually unknown
                  beyond its members. No book had ever really hinted of it, though the deathless Chinamen
                  said that there were double meanings in the Necronomicon of the mad Arab Abdul Alhazred which the initiated might read as they chose, especially the much-discussed couplet:
                  
               </p>
               
               <p>

               <p>
                  Legrasse, deeply impressed and not a little bewildered, had inquired in vain concerning the
                  historic affiliations of the . Castro, apparently, had told the truth when he said
                  that it was wholly secret. The authorities at Tulane University could shed no light upon either  or image, and now the detective had come to the
                  highest authorities in the country and met with no more than the Greenland tale of Professor Webb.
                  
               </p>
               
               <p>The feverish interest aroused at the meeting by Legrasse's tale, corroborated as it was by the statuette, is echoed in the subsequent correspondence
                  of those who attended; although scant mention occurs in the formal publications of
                  the society. Caution is the first care of those accustomed to face occasional charlatanry
                  and imposture. Legrasse for some time lent the image to Professor Webb, but at the latter's death it was returned to him and remains in his possession,
                  where I viewed it not long ago. It is truly a terrible thing, and unmistakably akin
                  to the dream-sculpture of young Wilcox.
                  
               </p>
               
               <p>That my uncle was excited by the tale of the sculptor I did not wonder, for what thoughts
                  must arise upon hearing, after a knowledge of what Legrasse had learned of the cult, of a sensitive young man who had dreamed not only the figure and exact hieroglyphics
                  of the swamp-found image and the Greenland devil tablet, but had come in his dreams
                  upon at least three of the precise words of the formula uttered alike by

Professor Angell's instant start on an investigation of the utmost thoroughness was eminently natural;
                  though privately I suspected young Wilcox of having heard of the  in some indirect way, and of having invented a series of
                  dreams to heighten and continue the

                  were, of course, strong corroboration; but the rationalism of my mind and the extravagance
                  of the whole subject led me to adopt what I thought the most sensible conclusions.
                  So, after thoroughly studying the manuscript again and correlating the theosophical
                  and anthropological notes with the cult narrative of Legrasse, I made a trip to Providence to see the sculptor and give him the rebuke I thought proper for so boldly imposing

                  about that his genius is indeed profound and authentic. He will, I believe, some time
                  be heard from as one of the great decadents; for he has crystallised in clay and will
                  one day mirror in marble those nightmares and phantasies which Arthur Machen evokes
                  in prose, and Clark Ashton Smith makes visible in verse and in painting.
                  
               </p>
               
               <p>Dark, frail, and somewhat unkempt in aspect, he turned languidly at my knock and asked
                  me my business without rising. When I told him who I was, he displayed some interest;
                  for my uncle had excited his curiosity in probing his strange dreams, yet had never
                  explained the reason for the study. I did not enlarge his knowledge in this regard,
                  but sought with some subtlety to draw him out. In a short time I became convinced
                  of his absolute sincerity, for he spoke of the dreams in a manner none could mistake.
                  They and their subconscious residuum had influenced his art profoundly, and he shewed
                  me a morbid statue whose contours almost made me shake with the potency of its black
                  suggestion. He could not recall having seen the original of this thing except in his
                  own dream bas-relief, but the outlines had formed themselves insensibly under his
                  hands. It was, no doubt, the giant shape he had raved of in delirium. That he really
                  knew nothing of the hidden , save from what my uncle's relentless catechism had let
                  fall, he soon made clear; and again I strove to think of some way in which he could
                  possibly have received the weird impressions.
                  
               </p>
               
               <p>He talked of his dreams in a strangely poetic fashion; making me see with terrible

                     Cthulhu fhtagn”</q>. These words had formed part of that dread ritual which told of dead Cthulhu's dream-vigil in his stone vault at R'lyeh, and I felt deeply moved despite my rational beliefs. Wilcox, I was sure, had heard of the  in some casual way, and had soon forgotten it amidst
                  the mass of his equally weird reading and imagining. Later, by virtue of its sheer
                  impressiveness, it had found subconscious expression in dreams, in the bas-relief,
                  and in the terrible statue I now beheld; so that his imposture upon my uncle had been
                  a very innocent one. The youth was of a type, at once slightly affected and slightly
                  ill-mannered, which I could never like; but I was willing enough now to admit both
                  his genius and his honesty. I took leave of him amicably, and wish him all the success
                  his talent promises.

               <p>The matter of the  still remained to fascinate me, and at times I had visions of personal
                  fame from researches into its origin and connexions. I visited New Orleans, talked with Legrasse and others of that old-time raiding-party, saw the frightful image, and even questioned
                  such of the mongrel prisoners as still survived. Old Castro, unfortunately, had been dead for some years. What I now heard so graphically at
                  first-hand, though it was really no more than a detailed confirmation of what my uncle
                  had written, excited me afresh; for I felt sure that I was on the track of a very

                  for it was an old number of an Australian journal, the Sydney Bulletin for April 18, 1925. It had escaped even the cutting bureau which had at the time of its issuance been
                  avidly collecting material for my uncle's research.
                  
               </p>
               
               <p>I had largely given over my inquiries into what Professor Angell called the <q>“Cthulhu Cult”</q>, and was visiting a learned friend in Paterson, New Jersey; the curator of a local
                  museum and a mineralogist of note. Examining one day the reserve specimens roughly
                  set on the storage shelves in a rear room of the museum, my eye was caught by an odd
                  picture in one of the old papers spread beneath the stones. It was the Sydney Bulletin
                  I have mentioned, for my friend has wide affiliations in all conceivable foreign parts;
                  and the picture was a half-tone cut of a hideous stone image almost identical with
                  that which Legrasse had found in the swamp.

                  and was disappointed to find it of only moderate length. What it suggested, however,
                  was of portentous significance to my flagging quest; and I carefully tore it out for
                  immediate action. It read as follows:

               <p>The Morrison Co.'s freighter Vigilant, bound from Valparaiso, arrived this morning
                  at its wharf in Darling Harbour, having in tow the battled and disabled but heavily
                  armed steam yacht Alert of Dunedin, N. Z., which was sighted April 12th in W. Longitude 152 17' with one living and one dead man aboard.

               <p>The Vigilant left Valparaiso March 25th, and on April 2nd was driven considerably
                  south of her course by exceptionally heavy storms and monster waves. On April 12th
                  the derelict was sighted; and though apparently deserted, was found upon boarding
                  to contain one survivor in a half-delirious condition and one man who had evidently
                  been dead for more than a week. The living man was clutching a horrible stone

                  in a small carved shrine of common pattern.
                  
               </p>
               
               <p>This man, after recovering his senses, told an exceedingly strange story of piracy
                  and slaughter. He isGustaf Johansen, a Norwegian of some intelligence, and had been second mate of the two-masted schooner
                  Emma of Auckland, which sailed for Callao February 20th with a complement of eleven
                  men. The Emma, he says, was delayed and thrown widely south of her course by the great
                  storm of March 1st, and on March 22nd, in W. Longitude 128 34', encountered the Alert, manned by a queer and evil-looking crew of 
                  <mark class="scientific" title="0">Kanakas</mark><span class="note"></span> and half-castes. Being ordered peremptorily to turn back, Capt. Collins refused;
                  whereupon the strange crew began to fire savagely and without warning upon the schooner
                  with a peculiarly heavy battery of brass cannon forming part of the yacht's equipment.
                  The Emma's men shewed fight, says the survivor, and though the schooner began to sink
                  from shots beneath the waterline they managed to heave alongside their enemy and board
                  her, grappling with the savage crew on the yacht's deck, and being forced to kill
                  them all, the number being slightly superior, because of their particularly abhorrent
                  and desperate though rather clumsy mode of fighting.
                  
               </p>
               
               <p>Three of the Emma's men, including Capt. Collins and First Mate Green, were killed;
                  and the remaining eight under Second Mate Johansen proceeded to navigate the captured yacht, going ahead in their original direction
                  to see if any reason for their ordering back had existed. The next day, it appears,
                  they raised and landed on a small island, although none is known to exist in that
                  part of the ocean; and six of the men somehow died ashore, though Johansen is queerly
                  reticent about this part of his story, and speaks only of their falling into a rock
                  chasm. Later, it seems, he and one companion boarded the yacht and tried to manage
                  her, but were beaten about by the storm of April 2nd. From that time till his rescue
                  on the 12th the man remembers little, and he does not even recall when William Briden,
                  his companion, died. Briden's death reveals no apparent cause, and was probably due
                  to excitement or exposure. Cable advices from Dunedin report that the Alert was well known there as an island trader, and bore an evil
                  reputation along the waterfront. It was owned by a curious group of half-castes whose
                  frequent meetings and night trips to the woods attracted no little curiosity; and
                  it had set sail in great haste just after the storm and earth tremors of March 1st.
                  Our Auckland correspondent gives the Emma and her crew an excellent reputation, and
                  Johansen is described as a sober and worthy man. The admiralty will institute an inquiry
                  on the whole matter beginning tomorrow, at which every effort will be made to induce
                  Johansen to speak more freely than he has done hitherto.

Here were new treasuries
                  of data on the Cthulhu Cult, and evidence that it had strange interests at sea as well as on land. What
                  motive prompted the hybrid crew to order back the Emma as they sailed about with their
                  hideous

What was the unknown island on which six of the Emma's crew had died, and about
                  which the mate Johansen was so secretive? What had the vice-admiralty's investigation
                  brought out, and what was known of the noxious  in Dunedin? And most marvellous of all, what deep and more than natural linkage of dates was
                  this which gave a malign and now undeniable significance to the various turns of events
                  so carefully noted by my uncle?

               <p>March 1st—our February 28th according to the International Date Line—the earthquake
                  and storm had come. From Dunedin the Alert and her noisome crew had darted eagerly forth as if imperiously summoned,
                  and on the other side of the earth poets and artists had begun to dream of a strange,
                  dank

March 23d the crew of the Emma landed on an unknown island and left six men dead;
                  and on that date the dreams of sensitive men assumed a heightened vividness and darkened
                  with dread of a giant monster's malign pursuit, whilst an architect had gone mad and
                  a sculptor had lapsed suddenly into delirium! And what of this storm of April 2nd—the
                  date on which all dreams of the dank city ceased, and Wilcox emerged unharmed from the bondage of strange fever? What of all this—and of those
                  hints of old Castro about the sunken, star-born Old Ones and their coming reign; their
                  faithful  and their mastery of dreams? Was I tottering on the brink of cosmic horrors
                  beyond man's power to bear? If so, they must be horrors of the mind alone, for in
                  some way the second of April had put a stop to whatever monstrous menace had begun
                  its siege of mankind's soul.
                  
               </p>
               
               <p>That evening, after a day of hurried cabling and arranging, I bade my host adieu and
                  took a train for San Francisco. In less than a month I was in Dunedin; where, however, I found that little was known of the strange -members who had lingered
                  in the old sea-taverns. Waterfront scum was far too common for special mention; though
                  there was vague talk about one inland trip these mongrels had made, during which faint
                  drumming and red flame were noted on the distant hills. In Auckland I learned that
                  Johansen had returned with yellow hair turned white after a perfunctory and inconclusive
                  questioning at Sydney, and had thereafter sold his cottage in West Street and sailed
                  with his wife to his old home in Oslo. Of his stirring experience he would tell his
                  friends no more than he had told the admiralty officials, and all they could do was
                  to give me his Oslo address.
               </p>
               
               <p>After that I went to Sydney and talked profitlessly with seamen and members of the
                  vice-admiralty court. I saw the Alert, now sold and in commercial use, at Circular
                  Quay in Sydney Cove, but gained nothing from its non-committal bulk. The crouching
                  image with its cuttlefish head, dragon body, scaly wings, and hieroglyphed pedestal,
                  was preserved in the Museum at Hyde Park; and I studied it long and well, finding
                  it a thing of

                  the curator told me, had found it a monstrous puzzle; for they vowed that the world
                  held no rock like it. Then I thought with a shudder of what old Castro had told Legrasse about the primal Great Ones: “They had come from the stars, and had brought Their
                  images with Them.”
               </p>
               
               <p>Shaken with such a mental revolution as I had never before known, I now resolved to
                  visit Mate Johansen in Oslo. Sailing for London, I reëmbarked at once for the Norwegian capital; and one autumn day landed at the
                  trim wharves in the shadow of the Egeberg. Johansen's address, I discovered, lay in
                  the Old Town of King Harold Haardrada, which kept alive the name of Oslo during all
                  the centuries that the greater city masqueraded as “Christiana”. I made the brief
                  trip by taxicab, and knocked with palpitant heart at the door of a neat and

               <p>He had not survived his return, said his wife, for the doings at sea in 1925 had broken
                  him. He had told her no more than he had told the public, but had left a long manuscript—of
                  “technical matters” as he said—written in English, evidently in order to safeguard
                  her from the peril of casual perusal. During a walk through a narrow lane near the
                  Gothenburg dock, a bundle of papers fallingG from an attic window had knocked him down. Two Lascar
                  sailors at once helped him to his feet, but before the ambulance could reach him he
                  was dead. Physicians found no adequate cause for the end, and laid it to heart trouble
                  and a weakened constitution.
               </p>
               
               <p>I now felt gnawing at my vitals that dark terror which will never leave me till I,
                  too, am at rest; “accidentally” or otherwise. Persuading the widow that my connexion
                  with her husband's “technical matters” was sufficient to entitle me to his manuscript,
                  I bore the document away and began to read it on the London boat. It was a simple,
                  rambling thing—a naive sailor's effort at a post-facto diary—and strove to recall
                  day by day that last awful voyage. I cannot attempt to transcribe it verbatim in all
                  its cloudiness and redundance, but I will tell its gist enough to shew why the sound
                  of the water against the vessel's sides became so unendurable to me that I stopped
                  my ears with cotton.

                  Johansen's voyage had begun just as he told it to the vice-admiralty. The Emma, in ballast,
                  had cleared Auckland on February 20th, and had felt the full force of that earthquake-born tempest which must have heaved
                  up from the sea-bottom the horrors that filled men's dreams. Once more under control,
                  the ship was making good progress when held up by the Alert on March 22nd, and I could feel the mate's regret as he wrote of her bombardment and sinking. Of
                  the swarthy -fiends on the Alert he speaks with significant horror. There was some
                  peculiarly abominable quality about them which made their destruction seem almost
                  a duty, and Johansen shews ingenuous wonder at the charge of ruthlessness brought
                  against his party during the proceedings of the court of inquiry. Then, driven ahead

                  that seeped down from the dark stars. There lay great Cthulhu and his hordes, hidden in green slimy vaults and sending out at last, after cycles

                  imperiously to the faithful to come on a pilgrimage of liberation and restoration.

                  great Cthulhu was buried, actually emerged from the waters. When I think of the extent of all that
                  may be brooding down there I almost wish to kill myself forthwith. Johansen and his
                  men were awed by the cosmic majesty of this dripping Babylon of elder

                  planet. Awe at the unbelievable size of the greenish stone blocks, at the dizzying

               <p>Without knowing what futurism is like, Johansen achieved something very close to it when he spoke of the city; for instead of describing
                  any definite structure or building, he dwells only on broad impressions of vast angles
                  and stone surfaces—surfaces too great to belong to any thing right or proper for this
                  earth, and impious with horrible images and hieroglyphs. I mention his talk about
                  angles because it suggests something Wilcox had told me of his awful dreams. He had said that the geometry of the dream-place

                  Johansen and his men landed at a sloping mud-bank on this monstrous Acropolis, and clambered
                  slipperily up over titan oozy blocks which could have been no mortal staircase. The
                  very sun of heaven seemed distorted when viewed through the polarising miasma welling
                  out from this sea-soaked perversion, and twisted menace and suspense lurked leeringly
                  in those crazily elusive angles of carven rock where a second glance shewed concavity
                  after the first shewed convexity.
                  
               </p>
               
               <p>Something very like fright had come over all the explorers before anything more definite
                  than rock and ooze and weed was seen. Each would have fled had he not feared the scorn
                  of the others, and it was only half-heartedly that they searched—vainly, as it proved—for
                  some portable souvenir to bear away.
                  
               </p>
               
               <p>It was Rodriguez the Portuguese who climbed up the foot of the monolith and shouted of what he had
                  found. The rest followed him, and looked curiously at the immense carved door with
                  the now familiar squid-dragon bas-relief. It was, Johansen said, like a great barn-door; and they all felt that it was a door because of the
                  ornate lintel, threshold, and jambs around it, though they could not decide whether
                  it lay flat like a trap-door or slantwise like an outside cellar-door. As Wilcox would have said, the geometry of the place was all wrong. One could not be sure that
                  the sea and the ground were horizontal, hence the relative position of everything
                  else seemed 
                  <mark class="other" title="0">phantasmally</mark><span class="note"></span> variable.

                  Briden pushed at the stone in several places without result. Then Donovan felt over it delicately around the edge, pressing each point separately as he went.
                  He climbed interminably along the

                  very softly and slowly, the acre-great panel began to give inward at the top; and
                  they saw that it was balanced. Donovan slid or somehow propelled himself down or along
                  the jamb and rejoined his fellows, and everyone watched the queer recession of the

They were Donovan, Guerrera, and Ångstrom. Parker slipped as the other three were plunging frenziedly over endless vistas of green-crusted
                  rock to the boat, and Johansen swears he was swallowed up by an angle of masonry which shouldn't have been there;
                  an angle which was acute, but behaved as if it were obtuse. So only Briden and Johansen reached the boat, and pulled desperately for the Alert as the mountainous monstrosity
                  flopped down the slimy stones and hesitated floundering at the edge of the water.
                  
               </p>
               
               <p>Steam had not been suffered to go down entirely, despite the departure of all hands
                  for the shore; and it was the work of only a few moments of feverish rushing up and
                  down between wheel and engines to get the Alert under way. Slowly, amidst the distorted
                  horrors of that indescribable scene, she began to churn the lethal waters; whilst
                  on the masonry of that charnel shore that was not of earth the titan Thing from the
                  stars slavered and gibbered like 
                  <mark class="other" title="0">Polypheme</mark><span class="note"></span> cursing the fleeing ship of Odysseus. Then, bolder than the storied Cyclops, great
                  Cthulhu slid greasily into the water and began to pursue with vast wave-raising strokes of
                  cosmic potency. Briden looked back and went mad, laughing shrilly as he kept on laughing at intervals till
                  death found him one night in the cabin whilst Johansen was wandering deliriously.

               <p>But Johansen had not given out yet. Knowing that the Thing could surely overtake the
                  Alert until steam was fully up, he resolved on a desperate chance; and, setting the
                  engine for full speed, ran lightning-like on deck and reversed the wheel. There was
                  a mighty eddying and foaming in the noisome brine, and as the steam mounted higher
                  and higher the brave Norwegian drove his vessel head on against the pursuing jelly
                  which rose above the unclean froth like the stern of a
