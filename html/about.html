            <h2> The overall purpose of this project is to analyse a compendium of Lovecraft's
                peculiar vocabulary that elicit a feeling of either confusion, ambiguity, or dread.
                Our research initially sought out words that are either archaic or obsolete within
                the modern English vocabulary. That is, do these obsolete words carry any intent to
                conjure an emotional response to the "eldritch" context of his works. Our research
                yielded little in this regard, due to the absence of numerous anachronistic words.
                However, we did notice the intentional usage of scientific, religious, and Gothic
                terms which evoked what can best be described culturally and emotionally as the
                "biological sublime"; an overwhelming experience of the uncanny stimulated by
                Lovecraft's phantasmagorical prose. We used TEI markup to capture these words. Upon
                collecting 666 words, we became curious as to the ambiguity of certain terms within
                our categories of word groups. From here, we used Python and XSLT in order to create
                a word list of tagged words, their word types, and a representation of ambiguity
                based on analysis of synsets. Synsets are a representation of ambiguity because the
                number of synsets per word indicates the number of alternate meanings. Finally, we
                reincorporated the synset and definition information via Python into our HTML
                representation of our chosen set of Lovecraft's texts. We determined that our corpus
                of texts incorporated more scientific terms than expected. This led to our
                conclusion that these texts have an inclusive set of words that play to what
                Lovecraft deemed the "fear of the unknown," through what is threatening to the
                human-centric world view. </h2>

            <h2> H.P Lovecraft is an early twentieth century writer of "weird fiction." His works
                are compared to the supernatural heritage of nineteenth century Gothic fiction. The
                prose of Lovecraft is what distinguishes him from other writers of horror. His
                verbose style is laden with exotic adjectives and archaic references, which serve to
                confound the average reader, as Lovecraft wrote pedantically and not to the
                comprehension level of his readership. His worldview held that humankind is a tragic
                cosmic accident that is mocked by an ancient race of extraterrestrial gods known as
                “The Great Old Ones.” Among these beings are: Cthulhu, Nyarlathotep, and
                Yog-Sothoth. The tales involving these deities are replete with madness, horror, and
                bizarre mutations. The Great Old One’s hold humankind with utter indifference, with
                the exception of the select few who are sensitive to the powers of The Great Old
                Ones and wish to resurrect them from the darkest regions of the space. This is
                facilitated by delving into the horrid words of Lovecraft’s forbidden grimoire, "The
                Necronomicon." The author has crafted many characters who thirst for knowledge and
                seek to uncover esoteric secrets. These damned figures unleash a bevy of horrors
                upon an unsuspecting New England. The protagonists of these tales are subjected to
                atrocities wrought by an unforgiving cosmos and as a result, they go irretrievably
                insane. We chose our corpus of texts, from the Cthulhu mythos, to reflect these
                uncanny culture characteristics of Lovecraft's prose. </h2>

            <h4>There are many things used within this project that we did not create. These things
                range from the Music used on the intro page as well as background images. This is a
                section of our about page we where will be giving credit to those people.
                <br /><br /> The Intro Music that we used comes from the famous Anime <b>Death
                    Note</b> OST, The music was created by composer and musician Hideki Taniuchi and
                composer Yoshihisa Hirano. We took snippets from the song and edited them in the
                editing program called Audacity and added it onto the site. <br /><br /> The
                Background used for our homepage was obtained from <a href="www.deviantart.com/"
                    >www.deviantart.com</a> from the user <b>JJcanvas</b>. <br /><br /> The
                Background image used for this about page I got from <a
                    href="https://alpha.wallhaven.cc/wallpaper/358633">alpha.wallhaven.cc</a>
                <br /><br /> The Background image for our analysis page is credited within the
                background. <br /><br /> The music on our Analysis page comes from 2 different
                sources. There is a separate audio clip for the rain noises and one for the creaking
                ship sounds. The rain noise comes from a video on YouTube that clipped out the rain
                from the Halo Reach Theater Lobby. All Rights go to the composers of music and
                Bungie. The composers are Martin O'Donnell, Michael Salvatori. The Creaking Ship is
                a royalty free sound track from the YouTube channel n Beats Sound Effects. </h4>
