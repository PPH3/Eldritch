We have isolated these words and researched their meanings and their usages over time and how it changed. </h2>

              <h2> We worked with three stories form the Lovecraft library, all of which are a part of the Cthulhu mythos. The purpose of this project was to isolate the words we found that elicited a feeling of either confusion, ambiguity, or dread. With our research, we initially sought out words that are either archaic or obsolete within the modern English vocabulary. Our researched yielded little in this regard. The set of words we isolated carried either a gothic, religious, or scientific connotation; the latter category drawing the most words. Once we tagged exotic words in our TEI files, we delved into python and XSLT in order to create a word list in a separate file. 
                  <br /><br />This file was edited, and the select words had attributes of either gothic, religious, scientific, or other added to their tags. Our word selection and how we coded the associated markup was highly subjective. The three of us applied different reasoning to our respective working-texts. The attributes were all done by one coder and as a result, the subjectivity was extended. The result of the word analysis was that the words yielded a closer relationship to religious and scientific inferences than archaic references. In the end, the linguistic yield was vastly different than what was sought after.

                   <h4>There are many things used within this project that we did not create.  These things range from the Music used on the intro page as well as backgorund images.  This is a section of our about page we where will be giving credit to those people.  
                   <br /><br />
                   The Intro Music that we used comes from the famous Anime <b>Death Note</b> OST, The music was created by composer and musician Hideki Taniuchi and composer Yoshihisa Hirano. 
                   We took snippets from the song and edited them in the editing program called Audacity and added it onto the site.  
                       <br /><br />
                       The Background used for our homepage was obtained from  <a href="www.deviantart.com/">www.deviantart.com</a> from the user <b>JJcanvas</b>.

                       The Background image used for this about page I got from <a href="https://alpha.wallhaven.cc/wallpaper/358633">alpha.wallhaven.cc</a>

                       The music on our Analysis page comes from 2 different sources.  There is a separate audio clip for the rain noises and one for the creaking ship sounds.  The rain noise comes from a video on youtube that clipped out the rain from the Halo Reach Theater Lobby.  All Rights go to the composers of music and Bungie.  The composers are  Martin O'Donnell, Michael Salvatori.
                       The Creaking Ship is a royalty free sound track from the YouTube channel n Beats Sound Effects.
