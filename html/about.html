                <p>The overall purpose of this project is to analyze a compendium of Lovecraft's
                    peculiar vocabulary that elicit a feeling of confusion, ambiguity, and dread.
                    Our research initially sought out words that are either archaic or obsolete
                    within the modern English vocabulary. That is, do these obsolete words carry any
                    intent to conjure an emotional response to the "eldritch" context of his works.
                    Our research yielded little in this regard, due to the absence of numerous
                    anachronistic words. However, we did notice the intentional usage of scientific,
                    religious, and Gothic terms which evoked what can best be described culturally
                    and emotionally as the "biological sublime"; an overwhelming experience of the
                    uncanny stimulated by Lovecraft's phantasmagorical prose. </p>
                <p>We used TEI markup to capture these words. Upon collecting 666 words, we became
                    curious as to the ambiguity of certain terms within our categories of word
                    groups. From here, we used <a
                        href="https://github.com/PPH3/Eldritch/blob/master/xslt_and_python/lexAmb.py"
                        >Python</a> and <a
                        href="https://github.com/PPH3/Eldritch/blob/master/xslt_and_python/syn_to_fullList.xsl"
                        >XSLT</a> in order to create a <a
                        href="https://github.com/PPH3/Eldritch/blob/master/xslt_and_python/fullList_syn.xml"
                        >word list</a> of tagged words, their word types, and a representation of
                    ambiguity based on analysis of synsets. Having selected the most intriguing
                    words, we ran them through the search engine of wordnet. This program, stemming
                    from Python, functions as a dictionary/thesaurus tool; in which you can
                    determine a word’s synset count. Synsets are ultimately groups of synonyms, as
                    well as other possible contexts through which words can be employed. This
                    process yielded a decidedly indefinite framework for many of our words. Where we
                    thought certain words carried an obvious connotation, wordnet provided a
                    contrarian result. We then took to arranging the terms in a of hierarchy;
                    categorizing them according to their level of indistinctness.</p>
                <p>The Eldritch site features a table where the viewer can search through our
                    sizeable word-hoard and observe the words and measure their ambiguity.Finally,
                    we reincorporated the Python-generated synset and definition information via <a
                        href="https://github.com/PPH3/Eldritch/blob/master/xslt_and_python/text_java.xsl"
                        >XSLT</a> into our HTML representation of our chosen set of Lovecraft's
                    texts. We determined that our corpus of texts incorporated more scientific terms
                    than expected. This led to our conclusion that these texts have an inclusive set
                    of words that play to what Lovecraft deemed the "fear of the unknown," through
                    what is threatening to the human-centric world view.</p>

                <p> H.P Lovecraft is an early twentieth century writer of "weird fiction." His works
                    are compared to the supernatural heritage of nineteenth century Gothic fiction.
                    The prose of Lovecraft is what distinguishes him from other writers of horror.
                    His verbose style is laden with exotic adjectives and archaic references, which
                    serve to confound the average reader, as Lovecraft wrote pedantically and not to
                    the comprehension level of his readership. His worldview held that humankind is
                    a tragic cosmic accident that is mocked by an ancient race of extraterrestrial
                    gods known as “The Great Old Ones.” Among these beings are: Cthulhu,
                    Nyarlathotep, and Yog-Sothoth.</p>
                <p>The tales involving these deities are replete with madness, horror, and bizarre
                    mutations. The Great Old One’s hold humankind with utter indifference, with the
                    exception of the select few who are sensitive to the powers of The Great Old
                    Ones and wish to resurrect them from the darkest regions of the space. This is
                    facilitated by delving into the horrid words of Lovecraft’s forbidden grimoire,
                    "The Necronomicon." The author has crafted many characters who thirst for
                    knowledge and seek to uncover esoteric secrets. These damned figures unleash a
                    bevy of horrors upon an unsuspecting New England. The protagonists of these
                    tales are subjected to atrocities wrought by an unforgiving cosmos and as a
                    result, they go irretrievably insane. We chose our corpus of texts, from the
                    Cthulhu mythos, to reflect these uncanny culture characteristics of Lovecraft's
                    prose. </p>

                <p class="smaller">There are many things used within this project that we did not
                    create. These things range from the music used on the several of the page as
                    well as the background images. This is a section of our about page we where will
                    be giving credit to those people.</p>
                <p class="smaller">The music on the homepage comes from the famous Anime <b>Death
                        Note</b> OST, The music was created by composer and musician Hideki Taniuchi
                    and composer Yoshihisa Hirano. We took snippets from the song and edited them in
                    the editing program called Audacity and added it onto the site.The background
                    image used for our homepage was obtained from <a href="www.deviantart.com/"
                        >www.deviantart.com</a> from the user <b>JJcanvas</b>.</p>

                <p class="smaller">The background image for our "Texts" page is credited within the
                    background and the music on that page comes from two different sources. There is
                    a separate audio clip for the rain noises and one for the creaking ship sounds.
                    The rain noise comes from a video on YouTube that clipped out the rain from the
                    "Halo Reach Theater Lobby". Credit goes to the composers of that music and
                    "Bungie". The composers are Martin O'Donnell and Michael Salvatori. The creaking
                    ship sound is a royalty free sound track from the YouTube channel "n Beats Sound
