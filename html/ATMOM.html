         <p>I am forced into speech because men of science have refused to follow my advice without
            knowing why. It is altogether against my will that I tell my reasons for opposing
            this contemplated invasion of the <span title="scientific" class="anchor">antarctic</span><span class="note">Definition: the region around the south pole: Antarctica and surrounding waters; at or near the

         </p>
         
         
         <p>Doubt of the real facts, as I must reveal them, is inevitable; yet, if I suppressed
            what will seem extravagant and incredible, there would be nothing left. The hitherto
            withheld photographs, both ordinary and aerial, will count in my favor, for they are
            damnably vivid and graphic. Still, they will be doubted because of the great lengths
            to which clever fakery can be carried. The ink drawings, of course, will be jeered
            at as obvious impostures, notwithstanding a strangeness of technique which art experts
            ought to remark and puzzle over.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>In the end I must rely on the judgment and standing of the few scientific leaders
            who have, on the one hand, sufficient independence of thought to weigh my data on
            its own hideously convincing merits or in the light of certain <span title="scientific" class="anchor">primordial</span><span class="note">Definition: having existed from the beginning; in an earliest or original stage or

            in general from any rash and over-ambitious program in the region of those mountains
            of madness. It is an unfortunate fact that relatively obscure men like myself and
            my associates, connected only with a small university, have little chance of making
            an impression where matters of a wildly <span title="other" class="anchor">bizarre</span><span class="note">Definition: conspicuously or grossly unconventional or unusual<br />
               Word Type: other<br />
               Number Of Synsets: 1</span> or highly controversial nature are concerned.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>It is further against us that we are not, in the strictest sense, specialists in the
            fields which came primarily to be concerned. As a geologist, my object in leading
            the 
            Miskatonic University Expedition was wholly that of securing deep-level specimens of rock and soil from various parts
            of the <span title="scientific" class="anchor">antarctic</span><span class="note">Definition: the region around the south pole: Antarctica and surrounding waters; at or near the
               south pole<br />
               Word Type: scientific<br />
               Number Of Synsets: 2</span> continent, aided by the remarkable drill devised by Professor Frank H. Pabodie of our engineering department. I had no wish to be a pioneer in any other field than
            this, but I did hope that the use of this new mechanical appliance at different points
            along previously explored paths would bring to light materials of a sort hitherto
            unreached by the ordinary methods of collection.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>
            Pabodie's drilling apparatus, as the public already knows from our reports, was unique and
            radical in its lightness, portability, and capacity to combine the ordinary artesian
            drill principle with the principle of the small circular rock drill in such a way
            as to cope quickly with strata of varying hardness. Steel head, jointed rods, gasoline
            motor, collapsible wooden derrick, dynamiting paraphernalia, cording, rubbish-removal
            auger, and sectional piping for bores five inches wide and up to one thousand feet
            deep all formed, with needed accessories, no greater load than three seven-dog sledges
            could carry. This was made possible by the clever aluminum alloy of which most of
            the metal objects were fashioned. Four large Dornier aeroplanes, designed especially
            for the tremendous altitude flying necessary on the <span title="scientific" class="anchor">antarctic</span><span class="note">Definition: the region around the south pole: Antarctica and surrounding waters; at or near the

            to various suitable inland points, and from these points a sufficient quota of dogs
            would serve us.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>We planned to cover as great an area as one <span title="scientific" class="anchor">antarctic</span><span class="note">Definition: the region around the south pole: Antarctica and surrounding waters; at or near the

            to be of geological significance, we expected to <span title="other" class="anchor">unearth</span><span class="note">Definition: bring to light; recover through digging<br />

            life of which the lichens, marine fauna, arachnida, and penguins of the northern edge
            are the only survivals, is a matter of common information; and we hoped to expand
            that information in variety, accuracy, and detail. When a simple boring revealed <span title="scientific" class="anchor">fossiliferous</span><span class="note">Definition: bearing or containing fossils<br />
               Word Type: scientific<br />
               Number Of Synsets: 1</span> signs, we would enlarge the aperture by blasting, in order to get specimens of suitable
            size and condition.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>Our borings, of varying depth according to the promise held out by the upper soil
            or rock, were to be confined to exposed, or nearly exposed, land surfaces--these inevitably
            being slopes and ridges because of the mile or two-mile thickness of solid ice overlying
            the lower levels. We could not afford to waste drilling the depth of any considerable
            amount of mere glaciation, though Pabodie had worked out a plan for sinking copper electrodes in thick clusters of borings
            and melting off limited areas of ice with current from a gasoline-driven dynamo. It
            is this plan--which we could not put into effect except experimentally on an expedition
            such as ours--that the coming Starkweather-Moore Expedition proposes to follow, despite the warnings I have issued since our return from the
            <span title="scientific" class="anchor">antarctic</span><span class="note">Definition: the region around the south pole: Antarctica and surrounding waters; at or near the

         <p>The public knows of the Miskatonic Expedition through our frequent wireless reports to the Arkham Advertiser and Associated Press, and through the later articles of Pabodie and myself. We consisted of four men from the University--Pabodie, Lake of the biology department, Atwood of the physics department--also a meteorologist--and myself, representing geology
            and having nominal command--besides sixteen assistants: seven graduate students from
            Miskatonic and nine skilled mechanics. Of these sixteen, twelve were qualified aeroplane pilots,
            all but two of whom were competent wireless operators. Eight of them understood navigation
            with compass and sextant, as did Pabodie, Atwood, and I. In addition, of course, our two ships--wooden ex-whalers, reinforced for
            ice conditions and having auxiliary steam--were fully manned.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>The Nathaniel Derby Pickman Foundation, aided by a few special contributions, financed the expedition; hence our preparations
            were extremely thorough, despite the absence of great publicity. The dogs, sledges,
            machines, camp materials, and unassembled parts of our five planes were delivered
            in Boston, and there our ships were loaded. We were marvelously well-equipped for
            our specific purposes, and in all matters pertaining to supplies, regimen, transportation,
            and camp construction we profited by the excellent example of our many recent and
            exceptionally brilliant predecessors. It was the unusual number and fame of these
            predecessors which made our own expedition--ample though it was--so little noticed
            by the world at large.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>As the newspapers told, we sailed from Boston Harbor on September 2nd, 1930, taking a leisurely course down the coast and through the Panama Canal, and stopping at Samoa and Hobart, Tasmania, at which latter place we took on final supplies. None of our exploring party had
            ever been in the polar regions before, hence we all relied greatly on our ship captains--J. B. Douglas, commanding the brig Arkham, and serving as commander of the sea party, and Georg Thorfinnssen, commanding the barque Miskatonic--both veteran whalers in <span title="scientific" class="anchor">antarctic</span><span class="note">Definition: the region around the south pole: Antarctica and surrounding waters; at or near the

         <p>As we left the inhabited world behind, the sun sank lower and lower in the north,
            and stayed longer and longer above the horizon each day. At about 62Â° South Latitude we sighted our first icebergs--table-like objects with vertical sides--and just before
            reaching the <span title="scientific" class="anchor">antarctic</span><span class="note">Definition: the region around the south pole: Antarctica and surrounding waters; at or near the

            The falling temperature bothered me considerably after our long voyage through the
            tropics, but I tried to brace up for the worse rigors to come. On many occasions the
            curious atmospheric effects enchanted me vastly; these including a strikingly vivid
            mirage--the first I had ever seen--in which distant bergs became the battlements of
            unimaginable cosmic castles.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>Pushing through the ice, which was fortunately neither extensive nor thickly packed,
            we regained open water at South Latitude 77Â° 9'.

            lower horizon-grazing southern sun of midnight poured its hazy reddish rays over the
            white snow, bluish ice and water lanes, and black bits of exposed granite slope. Through
            the desolate summits swept ranging, intermittent gusts of the terrible <span title="scientific" class="anchor">antarctic</span><span class="note">Definition: the region around the south pole: Antarctica and surrounding waters; at or near the

            musical piping, with notes extending over a wide range, and which for some subconscious
            mnemonic reason seemed to me disquieting and even dimly terrible. Something about
            the scene reminded me of the strange and disturbing Asian paintings of Nicholas Roerich
            , and of the still stranger and more disturbing descriptions of the <span title="religious" class="anchor">evilly</span><span class="note">Definition: in a wicked evil manner<br />

         <p>On the 7th of November, sight of the westward range having been temporarily lost, we passed Franklin Island; and the next day descried the cones of Mts. Erebus and Terror on Ross Island ahead, with the long line of the Parry Mountains beyond. There now stretched off to the east the low, white line of the great ice
            barrier, rising perpendicularly to a height of two hundred feet like the rocky cliffs
            of Quebec, and marking the end of southward navigation. In the afternoon we entered McMurdo Sound and stood off the coast in the lee of smoking Mt. Erebus. The scoriac peak towered up some twelve thousand, seven hundred feet against the

         <p>Puffs of smoke from Erebus came intermittently, and one of the graduate assistants--a brilliant young fellow
            named Danforth--pointed out what looked like lava on the snowy slope, remarking that this mountain,
            discovered in 1840, had undoubtedly been the source of 
            Poe's image when he wrote seven years later:

         <p>Using small boats, we effected a difficult landing on Ross Island shortly after midnight on the morning of the 9th, carrying a line of cable from each of the ships and preparing to unload supplies
            by means of a breeches-buoy arrangement. Our sensations on first treading Antarctic soil were poignant and complex, even though at this particular point the 
            Scott and Shackleton expeditions had preceded us. Our camp on the frozen shore below the volcano's slope was only
            a provisional one, headquarters being kept aboard the Arkham. We landed all our drilling
            apparatus, dogs, sledges, tents, provisions, gasoline tanks, experimental ice-melting
            outfit, cameras, both ordinary and aerial, aeroplane parts, and other accessories,
            including three small portable wireless outfits--besides those in the planes--capable

         <p>I need not repeat what the newspapers have already published about our early work:
            of our ascent of Mt. Erebus; our successful mineral borings at several points on Ross Island and the singular speed with which Pabodie's apparatus accomplished them, even through solid rock layers; our provisional test
            of the small ice-melting equipment; our perilous ascent of the great barrier with

            atop the barrier. The health of our land party--twenty men and fifty-five Alaskan sledge dogs--was remarkable, though of course we had so far encountered no really
            destructive temperatures or windstorms. For the most part, the thermometer varied
            between zero and 20Â° or 25Â° above, and our experience with New England winters had accustomed us to rigors of this sort. The barrier camp was semi-permanent,
            and destined to be a storage cache for gasoline, provisions, dynamite, and other supplies.

         <p>Only four of our planes were needed to carry the actual exploring material, the fifth
            being left with a pilot and two men from the ships at the storage cache to form a
            means of reaching us from the Arkham in case all our exploring planes were lost. Later,
            when not using all the other planes for moving apparatus, we would employ one or two
            in a shuttle transportation service between this cache and another permanent base
            on the great plateau from six hundred to seven hundred miles southward, beyond Beardmore Glacier. Despite the almost unanimous accounts of appalling winds and tempests that pour
            down from the plateau, we determined to dispense with intermediate bases, taking our
            chances in the interest of economy and probable efficiency.

         <p>Wireless reports have spoken of the breathtaking, four-hour, nonstop flight of our
            squadron on November 21st over the lofty shelf ice, with vast peaks rising on the
            west, and the unfathomed silences echoing to the sound of our engines. Wind troubled
            us only moderately, and our radio compasses helped us through the one opaque fog we
            encountered. When the vast rise loomed ahead, between  and 84Â°, we knew we had reached Beardmore Glacier, the largest valley glacier in the world, and that the frozen sea was now giving
            place to a frowning and mountainous coast line. At last we were truly entering the

         </p>
         
         
         <p>The successful establishment of the southern base above the glacier in East Longitude 174Â° 23', and the phenomenally rapid and effective borings and blastings made at various points
            reached by our sledge trips and short aeroplane flights, are matters of history; as
            is the arduous and triumphant ascent of Mt. Nansen by Pabodie and two of the graduate students--Gedney and Carroll--on December 13-15. We were some eight thousand, five hundred feet above sea-level, and when experimental
            drillings revealed solid ground only twelve feet down through the snow and ice at
            certain points, we made considerable use of the small melting apparatus and sunk bores
            and performed dynamiting at many places where no previous explorer had ever thought
            of securing mineral specimens. The <span title="scientific" class="anchor">pre-Cambrian</span><span class="note"><br />

            These fragments came from a point to the westward, near the Queen Alexandra Range; and Lake, as a biologist, seemed to find their curious marking unusually puzzling and provocative,
            though to my geological eye it looked not unlike some of the ripple effects reasonably
            common in the sedimentary rocks. Since slate is no more than a metamorphic formation
            into which a sedimentary stratum is pressed, and since the pressure itself produces
            odd distorting effects on any markings which may exist, I saw no reason for extreme
            wonder over the striated depression.

         <p>On January 6th, 1931, Lake, Pabodie, Danforth, the other six students, and myself flew directly over the south pole in two of the
            great planes, being forced down once by a sudden high wind, which, fortunately, did
            not develop into a typical storm. This was, as the papers have stated, one of several
            observation flights, during others of which we tried to discern new topographical
            features in areas unreached by previous explorers. Our early flights were disappointing
            in this latter respect, though they afforded us some magnificent examples of the richly
            fantastic and deceptive mirages of the polar regions, of which our sea voyage had
            given us some brief foretastes. Distant mountains floated in the sky as enchanted

         <p>At length we resolved to carry out our original plan of flying five hundred miles
            eastward with all four exploring planes and establishing a fresh sub-base at a point
            which would probably be on the smaller continental division, as we mistakenly conceived
            it. Geological specimens obtained there would be desirable for purposes of comparison.
            Our health so far had remained excellent--lime juice well offsetting the steady diet

            without our thickest furs. It was now midsummer, and with haste and care we might

            deal, and with alarmingly radical daring, over that triangular striated marking in
            the slate; reading into it certain contradictions in nature and geological period
            which whetted his curiosity to the utmost, and made him avid to sink more borings

         <p>Popular imagination, I judge, responded actively to our wireless bulletins of Lake's start northwestward into regions never trodden by human foot or penetrated by human
            imagination, though we did not mention his wild hopes of revolutionizing the entire
            sciences of biology and geology. His preliminary sledging and boring journey of January 11th to 18th with Pabodie and five others--marred by the loss of two dogs in an upset when crossing one of
            the great pressure ridges in the ice--had brought up more and more of the <span title="scientific" class="anchor">Archaean</span><span class="note">Definition: of or relating to the earliest known rocks formed during the Precambrian

            of all four planes, many men, and the whole of the expedition's mechanical apparatus.
            I did not, in the end, veto the plan, though I decided not to accompany the northwestward
            party despite Lake's plea for my geological advice. While they were gone, I would remain at the base with
            Pabodie and five men and work out final plans for the eastward shift. In preparation for
            this transfer, one of the planes had begun to move up a good gasoline supply from
            McMurdo Sound; but this could wait temporarily. I kept with me one sledge and nine dogs, since

            Lake's sub-expedition into the unknown, as everyone will recall, sent out its own reports
            from the shortwave transmitters on the planes; these being simultaneously picked up
            by our apparatus at the southern base and by the Arkham at McMurdo Sound, whence they were relayed to the outside world on wave lengths up to fifty meters.
            The start was made January 22nd at 4 A.M., and the first wireless message we received came only two hours later,
            when Lake spoke of descending and starting a small-scale ice-melting and bore at a point some
            three hundred miles away from us. Six hours after that a second and very excited message
            told of the frantic, beaver-like work whereby a shallow shaft had been sunk and blasted,
            culminating in the discovery of slate fragments with several markings approximately
            like the one which had caused the original puzzlement.

            of a raw and piercing gale; and when I dispatched a message of protest against further
            hazards, Lake replied curtly that his new specimens made any hazard worth taking. I saw that his
            excitement had reached the point of mutiny, and that I could do nothing to check this
            headlong risk of the whole expedition's success; but it was appalling to think of
            his plunging deeper and deeper into that treacherous and sinister white immensity

         <p>Then, in about an hour and a half more, came that doubly excited message from Lake's moving plane, which almost reversed my sentiments and made me wish I had accompanied

         <p>After that Pabodie, the men and I hung breathlessly over the receiver. Thought of this titanic mountain
            rampart seven hundred miles away inflamed our deepest sense of adventure; and we rejoiced
            that our expedition, if not ourselves personally, had been its discoverers. In half
            an hour Lake called us again:

         <p>Though it was technically sleeping time, not one of us listeners thought for a moment
            of retiring.

         <p>From then on for another half hour Lake kept up a running fire of comment, and expressed his intention of climbing some of
            the peaks on foot. I replied that I would join him as soon as he could send a plane,
            and that Pabodie and I would work out the best gasoline plan--just where and how to concentrate our
            supply in view of the expedition's altered character. Obviously, Lake's boring operations, as well as his aeroplane activities, would require a great deal
            for the new base which he planned to establish at the foot of the mountains; and it
            was possible that the eastward flight might not be made, after all, this season. In
            connection with this business I called Captain Douglas and asked him to get as much as possible out of the ships and up the barrier with
            the single dog team we had left there. A direct route across the unknown region between
            Lake and McMurdo Sound was what we really ought to establish.

            Lake called me later to say that he had decided to let the camp stay where Moulton's plane had been forced down, and where repairs had already progressed somewhat. The
            ice sheet was very thin, with dark ground here and there visible, and he would sink
            some borings and blasts at that very point before making any sledge trips or climbing
            expeditions. He spoke of the ineffable majesty of the whole scene, and the <span title="gothic" class="anchor">queer</span><span class="note">Definition: offensive term for an openly homosexual man; hinder or prevent (the efforts, plans,

            shot up like a wall reaching the sky at the world's rim. Atwood's theodolite observations had placed the height of the five tallest peaks at from thirty
            thousand to thirty-four thousand feet. The windswept nature of the terrain clearly
            disturbed Lake, for it argued the occasional existence of prodigious gales, violent beyond anything
            we had so far encountered. His camp lay a little more than five miles from where the
            higher foothills rose abruptly. I could almost trace a note of subconscious alarm
            in his words--flashed across a glacial void of seven hundred miles--as he urged that
            we all hasten with the matter and get the strange, new region disposed of as soon
            as possible. He was about to rest now, after a continuous day's work of almost unparalleled
            speed, strenuousness, and results.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>In the morning I had a three-cornered wireless talk with Lake and Captain Douglas at their widely separated bases. It was agreed that one of Lake's planes would come to my base for Pabodie, the five men, and myself, as well as for all the fuel it could carry. The rest of
            the fuel question, depending on our decision about an easterly trip, could wait for
            a few days, since Lake had enough for immediate camp heat and borings. Eventually the old southern base
            ought to be restocked, but if we postponed the easterly trip we would not use it till
            the next summer, and, meanwhile, Lake must send a plane to explore a direct route between his new mountains and McMurdo Sound.

            already been reinforced by blocks of hard snow, and now we decided to complete the
            job of making a permanent village. Owing to a very liberal tent supply, Lake had with him all that his base would need, even after our arrival. I wirelessed that
            Pabodie and I would be ready for the northwestward move after one day's work and one night's
            rest.

            general program; hence he set up the drill and put five men to work with it while
            the rest finished settling the camp and repairing the damaged aeroplane. The softest
            visible rock--a sandstone about a quarter of a mile from the camp--had been chosen
            for the first sampling; and the drill made excellent progress without much supplementary
            blasting. It was about three hours afterward, following the first really heavy blast
            of the operation, that the shouting of the drill crew was heard; and that young Gedney--the acting foreman--rushed into the camp with the startling news.

            a wholly new and doubly intense wave of excitement spread among the excavators. A

            fairly well, though wind is bad. Must establish plane communication with McMurdo Sound and begin shipping material. But I've got to dissect one of these things before we

         <p>The sensations of Pabodie and myself at receipt of this report were almost beyond description, nor were our
            companions much behind us in enthusiasm. McTighe, who had hastily translated a few high spots as they came from the droning receiving
            set, wrote out the entire message from his shorthand version as soon as Lake's operator signed off. All appreciated the <span title="other" class="anchor">epoch-making</span><span class="note">Definition: highly significant or important especially bringing about or marking the

            parts as requested; and my example was followed by Sherman from his station at the McMurdo Sound supply cache, as well as by Captain Douglas of the Arkham. Later, as head of the expedition, I added some remarks to be relayed
            through the Arkham to the outside world. Of course, rest was an absurd thought amidst
            this excitement; and my only wish was to get to Lake's camp as quickly as I could. It disappointed me when he sent word that a rising mountain
            gale made early aerial travel impossible.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>But within an hour and a half interest again rose to banish disappointment. Lake, sending more messages, told of the completely successful transportation of the fourteen
            great specimens to the camp. It had been a hard pull, for the things were surprisingly
            heavy; but nine men had accomplished it very neatly. Now some of the party were hurriedly
            building a snow corral at a safe distance from the camp, to which the dogs could be
            brought for greater convenience in feeding. The specimens were laid out on the hard
            snow near the camp, save for one on which Lake was making crude attempts at dissection.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>This dissection seemed to be a greater task than had been expected, for, despite the
            heat of a gasoline stove in the newly raised laboratory tent, the deceptively flexible
            tissues of the chosen specimen--a powerful and intact one--lost nothing of their more
            than leathery toughness. Lake was puzzled as to how he might make the requisite incisions without violence destructive
            enough to upset all the structural niceties he was looking for. He had, it is true,
            seven more perfect specimens; but these were too few to use up recklessly unless the
            cave might later yield an unlimited supply. Accordingly he removed the specimen and
            dragged in one which, though having remnants of the starfish arrangements at both
            ends, was badly crushed and partly disrupted along one of the great torso furrows.

         <p>Results, quickly reported over the wireless, were baffling and provocative indeed.
            Nothing like delicacy or accuracy was possible with instruments hardly able to cut
            the anomalous tissue, but the little that was achieved left us all awed and bewildered.
            Existing biology would have to be wholly revised, for this thing was no product of
            any cell growth science knows about. There had been scarcely any mineral replacement,
            and despite an age of perhaps forty million years, the internal organs were wholly
            intact. The leathery, <span title="scientific" class="anchor">undeteriorative</span><span class="note"><br />

            blood, but a thick, dark-green fluid apparently answering the same purpose. By the
            time Lake reached this stage, all thirty-seven dogs had been brought to the still uncompleted
            corral near the camp, and even at that distance set up a savage barking and show of
            restlessness at the acrid, diffusive smell.

               Number Of Synsets: 2</span>. All guesses about its external members had been correct, and on the evidence of
            these one could hardly hesitate to call the thing animal; but internal inspection
            brought up so many vegetable evidences that Lake was left hopelessly at sea. It had digestion and circulation, and eliminated waste
            matter through the reddish tubes of its starfish-shaped base. Cursorily, one would
            say that its respiration apparatus handled oxygen rather than carbon dioxide, and
            there were odd evidences of air-storage chambers and methods of shifting respiration
            from the external orifice to at least two other fully developed breathing systems--gills
            and pores. Clearly, it was amphibian, and probably adapted to long airless hibernation
            periods as well. Vocal organs seemed present in connection with the main respiratory
            system, but they presented anomalies beyond immediate solution. Articulate speech,
            in the sense of syllable utterance, seemed barely conceivable, but musical piping
            notes covering a wide range were highly probable. The muscular system was almost prematurely
            developed.

         <h3>III</h3>
         
         
         <p>None of us, I imagine, slept very heavily or continuously that morning. Both the excitement
            of Lake's discovery and the mounting fury of the wind were against such a thing. So savage
            was the blast, even where we were, that we could not help wondering how much worse
            it was at Lake's camp, directly under the vast unknown peaks that bred and delivered it. McTighe was awake at ten o'clock and tried to get Lake on the wireless, as agreed, but some electrical condition in the disturbed air to
            the westward seemed to prevent communication. We did, however, get the Arkham, and
            Douglas told me that he had likewise been vainly trying to reach Lake. He had not known about the wind, for very little was blowing at McMurdo Sound, despite its persistent rage where we were.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>Throughout the day we all listened anxiously and tried to get Lake at intervals, but invariably without results. About noon a positive frenzy of wind
            stampeded out of the west, causing us to fear for the safety of our camp; but it eventually
            died down, with only a moderate relapse at 2 P.M. After three o'clock it was very
            quiet, and we redoubled our efforts to get Lake. Reflecting that he had four planes, each provided with an excellent short-wave outfit,
            we could not imagine any ordinary accident capable of crippling all his wireless equipment
            at once. Nevertheless the stony silence continued, and when we thought of the delirious
            force the wind must have had in his locality we could not help making the more direful
            conjectures.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>By six o'clock our fears had become intense and definite, and after a wireless consultation
            with Douglas and Thorfinnssen I resolved to take steps toward investigation. The fifth aeroplane, which we had
            left at the McMurdo Sound supply cache with Sherman and two sailors, was in good shape and ready for instant use, and it seemed that
            the very emergency for which it had been saved was now upon us. I got Sherman by wireless and ordered him to join me with the plane and the two sailors at the
            southern base as quickly as possible, the air conditions being apparently highly favorable.
            We then talked over the personnel of the coming investigation party, and decided that
            we would include all hands, together with the sledge and dogs which I had kept with
            me. Even so great a load would not be too much for one of the huge planes built to
            our special orders for heavy machinery transportation. At intervals I still tried
            to reach Lake with the wireless, but all to no purpose.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>
            Sherman, with the sailors Gunnarsson and Larsen, took off at 7:30, and reported a quiet flight from several points on the wing. They
            arrived at our base at midnight, and all hands at once discussed the next move. It
            was risky business sailing over the <span title="scientific" class="anchor">antarctic</span><span class="note">Definition: the region around the south pole: Antarctica and surrounding waters; at or near the

               Number Of Synsets: 2</span> in a single aeroplane without any line of bases, but no one drew back from what seemed
            like the plainest necessity. We turned in at two o'clock for a brief rest after some
            preliminary loading of the plane, but were up again in four hours to finish the loading
            and packing.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>At 7:15 A.M., January 25th, we started flying northwestward under McTighe's pilotage with ten men, seven dogs, a sledge, a fuel and food supply, and other items
            including the plane's wireless outfit. The atmosphere was clear, fairly quiet, and
            relatively mild in temperature, and we anticipated very little trouble in reaching
            the latitude and longitude designated by Lake as the site of his camp. Our apprehensions were over what we might find, or fail
            to find, at the end of our journey, for silence continued to answer all calls dispatched
            to the camp.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>Every incident of that four-and-a-half-hour flight is burned into my recollection
            because of its crucial position in my life. It marked my loss, at the age of fifty-four,
            of all that peace and balance which the normal mind possesses through its accustomed
            conception of external nature and nature's laws. Thenceforward the ten of us--but
            the student Danforth and myself above all others--were to face a hideously amplified world of lurking
            horrors which nothing can erase from our emotions, and which we would refrain from
            sharing with mankind in general if we could. The newspapers have printed the bulletins
            we sent from the moving plane, telling of our nonstop course, our two battles with
            treacherous upper-air gales, our glimpse of the broken surface where Lake had sunk his mid-journey shaft three days before, and our sight of a group of those
            strange fluffy snow cylinders noted by Amundsen and Byrd as rolling in the wind across the endless leagues of frozen plateau. There came a
            point, though, when our sensations could not be conveyed in any words the press would
            understand, and a latter point when we had to adopt an actual rule of strict censorship.

         <p>I was glad when the mirage began to break up, though in the process the various nightmare
            turrets and cones assumed distorted, temporary forms of even vaster hideousness. As
            the whole illusion dissolved to churning opalescence we began to look earthward again,
            and saw that our journey's end was not far off. The unknown mountains ahead rose dizzily
            up like a fearsome rampart of giants, their curious regularities showing with startling
            clearness even without a field glass. We were over the lowest foothills now, and could
            see amidst the snow, ice, and bare patches of their main plateau a couple of darkish
            spots which we took to be Lake's camp and boring. The higher foothills shot up between five and six miles away, forming
            a range almost distinct from the terrifying line of more than Himalayan peaks beyond
            them. At length Ropes--the student who had relieved McTighe at the controls--began to head downward toward the left-hand dark spot whose size
            marked it as the camp. As he did so, McTighe sent out the last uncensored wireless message the world was to receive from our expedition.

            found, and reluctantly announced the wiping out of the whole Lake party by the frightful wind of the preceding day, or of the night before that. Eleven
            known dead, young Gedney missing. People pardoned our hazy lack of details through realization of the shock
            the sad event must have caused us, and believed us when we explained that the mangling
            action of the wind had rendered all eleven bodies unsuitable for transportation outside.
            Indeed, I flatter myself that even in the midst of our distress, utter bewilderment,
            and soul-clutching horror, we scarcely went beyond the truth in any specific instance.
            The tremendous significance lies in what we dared not tell; what I would not tell
            now but for the need of warning others off from nameless terrors.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>It is a fact that the wind had brought dreadful havoc. Whether all could have lived
            through it, even without the other thing, is gravely open to doubt. The storm, with
            its fury of madly driven ice particles, must have been beyond anything our expedition
            had encountered before. One aeroplane shelter-wall, it seems, had been left in a far
            too flimsy and inadequate state--was nearly pulverized--and the derrick at the distant
            boring was entirely shaken to pieces. The exposed metal of the grounded planes and
            drilling machinery was bruised into a high polish, and two of the small tents were
            flattened despite their snow banking. Wooden surfaces left out in the blaster were
            pitted and denuded of paint, and all signs of tracks in the snow were completely obliterated.
            It is also true that we found none of the <span title="scientific" class="anchor">Archaean</span><span class="note">Definition: of or relating to the earliest known rocks formed during the Precambrian
               Eon<br />

            minerals from a vast, tumbled pile, including several of the greenish soapstone fragments
            whose odd five-pointed rounding and faint patterns of grouped dots caused so many
            doubtful comparisons; and some fossil bones, among which were the most typical of
            the curiously injured specimens.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>None of the dogs survived, their hurriedly built snow inclosure near the camp being
            almost wholly destroyed. The wind may have done that, though the greater breakage
            on the side next the camp, which was not the windward one, suggests an outward leap
            or break of the frantic <span title="other" class="anchor">beasts</span><span class="note">Definition: a living organism characterized by voluntary movement; a cruelly rapacious person<br />

            may have blown them off into the unknown. The drill and ice-melting machinery at the
            boring were too badly damaged to warrant salvage, so we used them to choke up that
            subtly disturbing gateway to the past which Lake had blasted. We likewise left at the camp the two most shaken up of the planes; since
            our surviving party had only four real pilots--Sherman, Danforth, McTighe, and Ropes--in all, with Danforth in a poor nervous shape to navigate. We brought back all the books, scientific equipment,
            and other incidentals we could find, though much was rather unaccountably blown away.
            Spare tents and furs were either missing or badly out of condition.

         <p>It was approximately 4 P.M., after wide plane cruising had forced us to give Gedney up for lost, that we sent our guarded message to the Arkham for relaying; and I think
            we did well to keep it as calm and noncommittal as we succeeded in doing. The most
            we said about agitation concerned our dogs, whose frantic uneasiness near the biological
            specimens was to be expected from poor Lake's accounts. We did not mention, I think, their display of the same uneasiness when
            sniffing around the <span title="gothic" class="anchor">queer</span><span class="note">Definition: offensive term for an openly homosexual man; hinder or prevent (the efforts, plans,

         <p>About the fourteen biological specimens, we were pardonably indefinite. We said that
            the only ones we discovered were damaged, but that enough was left of them to prove
            Lake's description wholly and impressively accurate. It was hard work keeping our personal
            emotions out of this matter--and we did not mention numbers or say exactly how we
            had found those which we did find. We had by that time agreed not to transmit anything

         <p>We were careful, too, about the public's general peace of mind; hence Danforth and I said little about that frightful trip over the mountains the next day. It was
            the fact that only a radically lightened plane could possibly cross a range of such
            height, which mercifully limited that scouting tour to the two of us. On our return

            not to show our sketches and the other things we brought away in our pockets, not
            to say anything more to the others than what we had agreed to relay outside, and to
            hide our camera films for private development later on; so that part of my present
            story will be as new to Pabodie, McTighe, Ropes, Sherman, and the rest as it will be to the world in general. Indeed, Danforth is closer mouthed than I: for he saw, or thinks he saw, one thing he will not tell
            even me.

         <p>This body of data is in every respect true so far as it goes, and it completely satisfied
            the men at the camp. We laid our absence of sixteen hours--a longer time than our

            Fortunately our tale sounded realistic and prosaic enough not to tempt any of the
            others into emulating our flight. Had any tried to do that, I would have used every
            ounce of my persuasion to stop them--and I do not know what Danforth would have done. While we were gone, Pabodie, Sherman, Ropes, McTighe, and Williamson had worked like beavers over Lake's two best planes, fitting them again for use despite the altogether unaccountable
            juggling of their operative mechanism.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>We decided to load all the planes the next morning and start back for our old base
            as soon as possible. Even though indirect, that was the safest way to work toward
            McMurdo Sound; for a straightline flight across the most utterly unknown stretches of the <span title="other" class="anchor">aeon-dead</span><span class="note"><br />

            in view of our tragic decimation and the ruin of our drilling machinery. The doubts
            and horrors around us--which we did not reveal--made us wish only to escape from this
            austral world of desolation and brooding madness as swiftly as we could.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>As the public knows, our return to the world was accomplished without further disasters.
            All planes reached the old base on the evening of the next day--January 27th--after a swift nonstop flight; and on the 28th we made McMurdo Sound in two laps, the one pause being very brief, and occasioned by a faulty rudder in
            the furious wind over the ice shelf after we had cleared the great plateau. In five
            days more, the Arkham and Miskatonic, with all hands and equipment on board, were shaking clear of the thickening field

            my soul to the quick. Less than a fortnight later we left the last hint of polar land

            would be enough to spur others ahead on the same age-long pursuit of the unknown.

            from showing the more puzzling of the scarred bones and greenish soapstones; while

         <h3>IV</h3>
         
         
         <p>It is only with vast hesitancy and repugnance that I let my mind go back to Lake's camp and what we really found there--and to that other thing beyond the mountains
            of madness. I am constantly tempted to shirk the details, and to let hints stand for
            actual facts and ineluctable deductions. I hope I have said enough already to let
            me glide briefly over the rest; the rest, that is, of the horror at the camp. I have
            told of the wind-ravaged terrain, the damaged shelters, the disarranged machinery,
            the varied uneasiness of our dogs, the missing sledges and other items, the deaths
            of men and dogs, the absence of Gedney, and the six insanely buried biological specimens, strangely sound in texture for
            all their structural injuries, from a world forty million years dead. I do not recall
            whether I mentioned that upon checking up the canine bodies we found one dog missing.
            We did not think much about that till later--indeed, only Danforth and I have thought of it at all.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>The principal things I have been keeping back relate to the bodies, and to certain
            subtle points which may or may not lend a hideous and incredible kind of rationale
            to the apparent chaos. At the time, I tried to keep the men's minds off those points;
            for it was so much simpler--so much more normal--to lay everything to an outbreak
            of madness on the part of some of Lake's party. From the look of things, that <span title="religious" class="anchor">demon</span><span class="note">Definition: an evil supernatural being; a cruel wicked and inhuman person; someone extremely diligent

            in some terrible kind of conflict, and were torn and mangled in fiendish and altogether
            inexplicable ways. Death, so far as we could judge, had in each case come from strangulation
            or laceration. The dogs had evidently started the trouble, for the state of their
            ill-built corral bore witness to its forcible breakage from within. It had been set
            some distance from the camp because of the hatred of the animals for those <span title="religious" class="anchor">hellish</span><span class="note">Definition: very unpleasant; extremely evil or cruel; expressive of cruelty or befitting hell<br />

            from the wind itself, or from some subtle, increasing odor emitted by the nightmare
            specimens, one could not say.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>But whatever had happened, it was hideous and revolting enough. Perhaps I had better
            put squeamishness aside and tell the worst at last--though with a categorical statement
            of opinion, based on the first-hand observations and most rigid deductions of both
            Danforth and myself, that the then missing Gedney was in no way responsible for the loathsome horrors we found. I have said that the
            bodies were frightfully mangled. Now I must add that some were incised and subtracted
            from in the most curious, cold-blooded, and <span title="scientific" class="anchor">inhuman</span><span class="note">Definition: without compunction or human feeling; belonging to or resembling something nonhuman<br />

               Number Of Synsets: 2</span> fashion. It was the same with dogs and men. All the healthier, fatter bodies, quadrupedal
            or bipedal, had had their most solid masses of tissue cut out and removed, as by a
            careful butcher; and around them was a strange sprinkling of salt--taken from the
            ravaged provision chests on the planes--which conjured up the most horrible associations.
            The thing had occurred in one of the crude aeroplane shelters from which the plane
            had been dragged out, and subsequent winds had effaced all tracks which could have
            supplied any plausible theory. Scattered bits of clothing, roughly slashed from the
            human incision subjects, hinted no clues. It is useless to bring up the half impression
            of certain faint snow prints in one shielded corner of the ruined inclosure--because
            that impression did not concern human prints at all, but was clearly mixed up with
            all the talk of fossil prints which poor Lake had been giving throughout the preceding weeks. One had to be careful of one's imagination
            in the lee of those overshadowing mountains of madness.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>As I have indicated, Gedney and one dog turned out to be missing in the end. When we came on that terrible shelter
            we had missed two dogs and two men; but the fairly unharmed dissecting tent, which
            we entered after investigating the <span title="other" class="anchor">monstrous</span><span class="note">Definition: abnormally large; shockingly brutal or cruel; distorted and unnatural in shape or

            and the jarringly comical heap of tin cans pried open in the most unlikely ways and
            at the most unlikely places. The profusion of scattered matches, intact, broken, or
            spent, formed another minor enigma--as did the two or three tent cloths and fur suits
            which we found lying about with peculiar and unorthodox slashings conceivably due
            to clumsy efforts at unimaginable adaptations. The maltreatment of the human and canine

            all the main evidences of insane disorder at the camp; and shall use the prints to

            indeed. The whole general formation, it must be made clear, seemed abominably suggestive

         <p>For madness--centering in Gedney as the only possible surviving agent--was the explanation spontaneously adopted by
            everybody so far as spoken utterance was concerned; though I will not be so naive
            as to deny that each of us may have harbored wild guesses which sanity forbade him
            to formulate completely. Sherman, Pabodie, and McTighe made an exhaustive aeroplane cruise over all the surrounding territory in the afternoon,
            sweeping the horizon with field glasses in quest of Gedney and of the various missing things; but nothing came to light. The party reported
            that the titan barrier range extended endlessly to right and left alike, without any
            diminution in height or essential structure. On some of the peaks, though, the regular
            cube and rampart formations were bolder and plainer, having doubly fantastic similitudes

            terror and bafflement--but not without a tentative plan for one or more range-crossing
            altitude flights in a lightened plane with aerial camera and geologist's outfit, beginning
            the following morning. It was decided that Danforth and I try it first, and we awaked at 7 A.M. intending an early flight; however, heavy
            winds--mentioned in our brief bulletin to the outside world--delayed our start till
            nearly nine o'clock.

            the hidden transmontane world--hints of the revelations which have finally driven
            Danforth to a nervous collapse. I wish he would add a really frank word about the thing which
            he thinks he alone saw--even though it was probably a nervous delusion--and which
            was perhaps the last straw that put him where he is; but he is firm against that.

            Danforth and I, studying the notes made by Pabodie in his afternoon flight and checking up with a sextant, had calculated that the lowest
            available pass in the range lay somewhat to the right of us, within sight of camp,
            and about twenty-three thousand or twenty-four thousand feet above sea level. For
            this point, then, we first headed in the lightened plane as we embarked on our flight
            of discovery. The camp itself, on foothills which sprang from a high continental plateau,
            was some twelve thousand feet in altitude; hence the actual height increase necessary
            was not so vast as it might seem. Nevertheless we were acutely conscious of the rarefied
            air and intense cold as we rose; for, on account of visibility conditions, we had
            to leave the cabin windows open. We were dressed, of course, in our heaviest furs.

            simpler equipment of earlier days. Somewhat to our surprise we saw that the terrain
            was far from difficult as such things go; and that despite the crevasses and other

         <p>The plane's fuel tank, in the interest of greater lightness, had been only partly
            filled; hence we now had to exert caution in our explorations. Even so, however, we
            covered an enormous extent of ground--or, rather, air--after swooping down to a level
            where the wind became virtually negligible. There seemed to be no limit to the mountain
            range, or to the length of the frightful stone city which bordered its inner foothills.
            Fifty miles of flight in each direction showed no major change in the labyrinth of
            rock and masonry that clawed up corpselike through the eternal ice. There were, though,
            some highly absorbing diversifications; such as the carvings on the canyon where that
            broad river had once pierced the foothills and approached its sinking place in the
            great range. The headlands at the stream's entrance had been boldly carved into <span title="scientific" class="anchor">Cyclopean</span><span class="note">Definition: of or relating to or resembling the Cyclops<br />

            various undulations in the terrain. Where a sharp hill rose, it was generally hollowed
            out into some sort of rambling-stone edifice; but there were at least two exceptions.
            Of these latter, one was too badly weathered to disclose what had been on the jutting

         <p>Flying inland from the mountains, we discovered that the city was not of infinite

            virtually without signs of sentient artifice. The course of the river beyond the city
            seemed marked by a broad, depressed line, while the land assumed a somewhat greater
            ruggedness, seeming to slope slightly upward as it receded in the mist-hazed west.

               Number Of Synsets: 3</span> structures would have been inconceivable. Accordingly, we decided to find a smooth
            place on the foothills near our navigable pass, there grounding the plane and preparing
            to do some exploration on foot. Though these gradual slopes were partly covered with
            a scattering of ruins, low flying soon disclosed an ampler number of possible landing
            places. Selecting that nearest to the pass, since our flight would be across the great
            range and back to camp, we succeeded about 12:30 P.M. in effecting a landing on a
            smooth, hard snow field wholly devoid of obstacles and well adapted to a swift and
            favorable take-off later on.

         <p>It did not seem necessary to protect the plane with a snow banking for so brief a
            time and in so comfortable an absence of high winds at this level; hence we merely
            saw that the landing skis were safely lodged, and that the vital parts of the mechanism
            were guarded against the cold. For our foot journey we discarded the heaviest of our
            flying furs, and took with us a small outfit consisting of pocket compass, hand camera,
            light provisions, voluminous notebooks and paper, geologist's hammer and chisel, specimen
            bags, coil of climbing rope, and powerful electric torches with extra batteries; this
            equipment having been carried in the plane on the chance that we might be able to
            effect a landing, take ground pictures, make drawings and topographical sketches,
            and obtain rock specimens from some bare slope, outcropping, or mountain cave. Fortunately
            we had a supply of extra paper to tear up, place in a spare specimen bag, and use

            quite symmetrically along the points of the star and at its inner angles, and with
            the bottoms about four feet from the glaciated surface. Looking through these, we
            could see that the masonry was fully five feet thick, that there were no partitions
            remaining within, and that there were traces of banded carvings or bas-reliefs on
            the interior walls--facts we had indeed guessed before, when flying low over this
            rampart and others like it. Though lower parts must have originally existed, all traces
            of such things were now wholly obscured by the deep layer of ice and snow at this
            point.

            flights had indicated that many buildings in the city proper were less ice-choked,
            and that we might perhaps find wholly clear interiors leading down to the true ground

            masonry or overarching bridges. Now, outspread below us, it loomed like a dream fantasy

            encountered a denser obstruction and plunged the scene into temporary shadow, the
            effect was subtly menacing in a way I can never hope to depict. Even the faint howling
            and piping of the unfelt wind in the great mountain passes behind us took on a wilder
            note of purposeful malignity. The last stage of our descent to the town was unusually
            steep and abrupt, and a rock outcropping at the edge where the grade changed led us
            to think that an artificial terrace had once existed there. Under the glaciation,
            we believed, there must be a flight of steps or its equivalent.

         <p>When at last we plunged into the town itself, clambering over fallen masonry and shrinking
            from the oppressive nearness and dwarfing height of omnipresent crumbling and pitted
            walls, our sensations again became such that I marvel at the amount of self-control
            we retained. Danforth was frankly jumpy, and began making some offensively irrelevant speculations about
            the horror at the camp--which I resented all the more because I could not help sharing
            certain conclusions forced upon us by many features of this morbid survival from nightmare
            antiquity. The speculations worked on his imagination, too; for in one place--where
            a debris-littered alley turned a sharp corner--he insisted that he saw faint traces
            of ground markings which he did not like; whilst elsewhere he stopped to listen to
            a subtle, imaginary sound from some undefined point--a muffled musical piping, he
            said, not unlike that of the wind in the mountain caves, yet somehow disturbingly
            different. The ceaseless five-pointedness of the surrounding architecture and of the

            carried out our program of chipping specimens from all the different rock types represented
            in the masonry. We wished a rather full set in order to draw better conclusions regarding

         <p>After a time we came across a row of windows--in the bulges of a colossal five-edged
            cone of undamaged apex--which led into a vast, well-preserved room with stone flooring;
            but these were too high in the room to permit descent without a rope. We had a rope
            with us, but did not wish to bother with this twenty-foot drop unless obliged to--especially
            in this thin plateau air where great demands were made upon the heart action. This
            enormous room was probably a hall or concourse of some sort, and our electric torches
            showed bold, distinct, and potentially startling sculptures arranged round the walls
            in broad, horizontal bands separated by equally broad strips of conventional <span title="gothic" class="anchor">arabesques</span><span class="note">Definition: position in which the dancer has one leg raised behind and arms outstretched in a

         <p>Finally, though, we did encounter exactly the opening we wished; an archway about
            six feet wide and ten feet high, marking the former end of an aerial bridge which
            had spanned an alley about five feet above the present level of glaciation. These
            archways, of course, were flush with upper-story floors, and in this case one of the
            floors still existed. The building thus accessible was a series of rectangular terraces
            on our left facing westward. That across the alley, where the other archway yawned,
            was a decrepit cylinder with no windows and with a curious bulge about ten feet above
            the aperture. It was totally dark inside, and the archway seemed to open on a well
            of illimitable emptiness.

         <p>Observing the many inner archways which led off from it, and realizing the probable
            complexity of the nest of apartments within, we decided that we must begin our system
            of hare-and-hound trail blazing. Hitherto our compasses, together with frequent glimpses
            of the vast mountain range between the towers in our rear, had been enough to prevent
            our losing our way; but from now on, the artificial substitute would be necessary.
            Accordingly we reduced our extra paper to shreds of suitable size, placed these in
            a bag to be carried by Danforth, and prepared to use them as economically as safety would allow. This method would
            probably gain us immunity from straying, since there did not appear to be any strong

            on this planet had synthesized their simple food forms and bred a good supply of Shoggoths,
            they allowed other cell groups to develop into other forms of animal and vegetable

         <p>The toughness of the things was almost incredible. Even the terrific pressure of the
            deepest sea bottoms appeared powerless to harm them. Very few seemed to die at all
            except by violence, and their burial places were very limited. The fact that they
            covered their vertically inhumed dead with five-pointed inscribed mounds set up thoughts
            in Danforth and me which made a fresh pause and recuperation necessary after the sculptures revealed

            lack of replacement needs, they did not encourage the large-scale development of new
            prothallia except when they had new regions to colonize. The young matured swiftly,
            and received an education evidently beyond any standard we can imagine. The prevailing
            intellectual and aesthetic life was highly evolved, and produced a tenaciously enduring
            set of customs and institutions which I shall describe more fully in my coming monograph.
            These varied slightly according to sea or land residence, but had the same foundations
            and essentials.

         <p>Though able, like vegetables, to derive nourishment from inorganic substances, they
            vastly preferred organic and especially animal food. They ate uncooked marine life
            under the sea, but cooked their viands on land. They hunted game and raised meat herds--slaughtering
            with sharp weapons whose odd marks on certain fossil bones our expedition had noted.
            They resisted all ordinary temperatures marvelously, and in their natural state could
            live in water down to freezing. When the great chill of the <span title="scientific" class="anchor">Pleistocene</span><span class="note">Definition: from two million to 11 thousand years ago; extensive glaciation of the northern

               Number Of Synsets: 1</span> drew on, however--nearly a million years ago--the land dwellers had to resort to
            special measures, including artificial heating--until at last the deadly cold appears

            or heat conditions--but by the time of the great cold they had lost track of the method.
            In any case they could not have prolonged the artificial state indefinitely without
            harm.

         <p>Being nonpairing and semivegetable in structure, the Old Ones had no biological basis for the family phase of mammal life, but seemed to organize
            large households on the principles of comfortable space-utility and--as we deduced
            from the pictured occupations and diversions of co-dwellers--congenial mental association.
            In furnishing their homes they kept everything in the center of the huge rooms, leaving
            all the wall spaces free for decorative treatment. Lighting, in the case of the land
            inhabitants, was accomplished by a device probably <span title="scientific" class="anchor">electro-chemical</span><span class="note"><br />

            There was extensive commerce, both local and between different cities--certain small,
            flat counters, five-pointed and inscribed, serving as money. Probably the smaller
            of the various greenish soapstones found by our expedition were pieces of such currency.
            Though the culture was mainly urban, some agriculture and much stock raising existed.
            Mining and a limited amount of manufacturing were also practiced. Travel was very
            frequent, but permanent migration seemed relatively rare except for the vast colonizing

            areas of the globe--hence the recommendation in my coming monograph that some archaeologist
            make systematic borings with Pabodie's type of apparatus in certain widely separated regions.

         <p>The steady trend down the ages was from water to land--a movement encouraged by the
            rise of new land masses, though the ocean was never wholly deserted. Another cause
            of the landward movement was the new difficulty in breeding and managing the Shoggoths upon which successful sea life depended. With the march of time, as the sculptures
            sadly confessed, the art of creating new life from inorganic matter had been lost,
            so that the Old Ones had to depend on the molding of forms already in existence. On land the great reptiles
            proved highly tractable; but theShoggoths of the sea, reproducing by fission and acquiring a dangerous degree of accidental
            intelligence, presented for a time a formidable problem.

         <p>I have said that our study of the decadent sculptures brought about a change in our
            immediate objective. This, of course, had to do with the chiseled avenues to the black
            inner world, of whose existence we had not known before, but which we were now eager
            to find and traverse. From the evident scale of the carvings we deduced that a steeply
            descending walk of about a mile through either of the neighboring tunnels would bring
            us to the brink of the dizzy, sunless cliffs about the great <span title="gothic" class="anchor">abyss</span><span class="note">Definition: a bottomless gulf or pit; any unfathomable (or apparently unfathomable) cavity or

               Number Of Synsets: 2</span>; down whose sides paths, improved by the Old Ones, led to the rocky shore of the hidden and nighted ocean. To behold this fabulous
            gulf in stark reality was a lure which seemed impossible of resistance once we knew
            of the thing--yet we realized we must begin the quest at once if we expected to include
            it in our present trip.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>It was now 8 P.M., and we did not have enough battery replacements to let our torches
            burn on forever. We had done so much studying and copying below the glacial level
            that our battery supply had had at least five hours of nearly continuous use, and
            despite the special dry cell formula, would obviously be good for only about four
            more--though by keeping one torch unused, except for especially interesting or difficult
            places, we might manage to eke out a safe margin beyond that. It would not do to be

            be possible, even in case of really lost direction, to work up to full daylight by
            one channel or another if granted sufficient time for plentiful trial and error. So
            at last we set off eagerly in the indicated direction of the nearest tunnel.

         <p>According to the carvings from which we had made our map, the desired tunnel mouth
            could not be much more than a quarter of a mile from where we stood; the intervening
            space showing solid-looking buildings quite likely to be penetrable still at a sub-glacial
            level. The opening itself would be in the basement--on the angle nearest the foothills--of
            a vast five-pointed structure of evidently public and perhaps ceremonial nature, which

         <p>No such structure came to our minds as we recalled our flight, hence we concluded
            that its upper parts had been greatly damaged, or that it had been totally shattered
            in an ice rift we had noticed. In the latter case the tunnel would probably turn out
            to be choked, so that we would have to try the next nearest one--the one less than
            a mile to the north. The intervening river course prevented our trying any of the
            more southern tunnels on this trip; and indeed, if both of the neighboring ones were
            choked it was doubtful whether our batteries would warrant an attempt on the next
            northerly one--about a mile beyond our second choice.

            by the sculptured walls along our route. Many must have told tales of immense historical
            importance, and only the prospect of later visits reconciled us to the need of passing
            them by. As it was, we slowed down once in a while and turned on our second torch.
            If we had had more films, we would certainly have paused briefly to photograph certain
            bas-reliefs, but time-consuming hand-copying was clearly out of the question.

            say what was wrong with the formerly crystal-pure air, but after a few seconds our

            had nauseated us upon opening the <span title="other" class="anchor">insane</span><span class="note">Definition: afflicted with or characteristic of mental derangement; very foolish<br />

         <p>Of course the revelation was not as clearly cut at the time as it sounds now. There
            were several conceivable explanations, and we did a good deal of indecisive whispering.
            Most important of all, we did not retreat without further investigation; for having
            come this far, we were loath to be balked by anything short of certain disaster. Anyway,
            what we must have suspected was altogether too wild to believe. Such things did not
            happen in any normal world. It was probably sheer irrational instinct which made us
            dim our single torch--tempted no longer by the decadent and sinister sculptures that
            leered menacingly from the oppressive walls--and which softened our progress to a
            cautious tiptoeing and crawling over the increasingly littered floor and heaps of
            debris.

            and corridors on the ground level. It did not look quite as it ought after countless
            thousands of years of desertion, and when we cautiously turned on more light we saw
            that a kind of swath seemed to have been lately tracked through it. The irregular
            nature of the litter precluded any definite marks, but in the smoother places there
            were suggestions of the dragging of heavy objects. Once we thought there was a hint
            of parallel tracks as if of runners. This was what made us pause again.

         <p>It was during that pause that we caught--simultaneously this time--the other odor
            ahead. Paradoxically, it was both a less frightful and more frightful odor--less frightful
            intrinsically, but infinitely appalling in this place under the known circumstances--unless,
            of course, Gedney--for the odor was the plain and familiar one of common petrol--every-day gasoline.

         <p>But we could not convince each other, or even ourselves, of anything definite. We
            had turned off all light as we stood still, and vaguely noticed that a trace of deeply
            filtered upper day kept the blackness from being absolute. Having automatically begun
            to move ahead, we guided ourselves by occasional flashes from our torch. The disturbed
            debris formed an impression we could not shake off, and the smell of gasoline grew
            stronger. More and more ruin met our eyes and hampered our feet, until very soon we
            saw that the forward way was about to cease. We had been all too correct in our pessimistic
            guess about that rift glimpsed from the air. Our tunnel quest was a blind one, and
            we were not even going to be able to reach the basement out of which the <span title="gothic" class="anchor">abyss</span><span class="note">Definition: a bottomless gulf or pit; any unfathomable (or apparently unfathomable) cavity or

               Number Of Synsets: 1</span> carved walls of the blocked corridor in which we stood, showed several doorways in
            various states of obstruction; and from one of them the gasoline odor--quite submerging
            that other hint of odor--came with especial distinctness. As we looked more steadily,
            we saw that beyond a doubt there had been a slight and recent clearing away of debris
            from that particular opening. Whatever the lurking horror might be, we believed the
            direct avenue toward it was now plainly manifest. I do not think anyone will wonder
            that we waited an appreciable time before making any further motion.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>And yet, when we did venture inside that black arch, our first impression was one
            of anticlimax. For amidst the littered expanse of that sculptured crypt--a perfect
            cube with sides of about twenty feet--there remained no recent object of instantly
            discernible size; so that we looked instinctively, though in vain, for a farther doorway.
            In another moment, however, Danforth's sharp vision had descried a place where the floor debris had been disturbed; and
            we turned on both torches full strength. Though what we saw in that light was actually
            simple and trifling, I am none the less reluctant to tell of it because of what it
            implied. It was a rough leveling of the debris, upon which several small objects lay
            carelessly scattered, and at one corner of which a considerable amount of gasoline
            must have been spilled lately enough to leave a strong odor even at this extreme superplateau
            altitude. In other words, it could not be other than a sort of camp--a camp made by
            questing beings who, like us, had been turned back by the unexpectedly choked way
            to the <span title="gothic" class="anchor">abyss</span><span class="note">Definition: a bottomless gulf or pit; any unfathomable (or apparently unfathomable) cavity or

         <p>Let me be plain. The scattered objects were, so far as substance was concerned, all

            books more or less curiously smudged, an empty ink bottle with its pictorial and instructional

            a used electric battery with circular of directions, a folder that came with our type
            of tent heater, and a sprinkling of crumpled papers. It was all bad enough but when
            we smoothed out the papers and looked at what was on them, we felt we had come to
            the worst. We had found certain inexplicably blotted papers at the camp which might
            have prepared us, yet the effect of the sight down there in the <span title="scientific" class="anchor">prehuman</span><span class="note"><br />

         <p>A mad Gedney might have made the groups of dots in imitation of those found on the greenish soapstones,
            just as the dots on those insane five-pointed grave mounds might have been made; and
            he might conceivably have prepared rough, hasty sketches--varying in their accuracy
            or lack of it--which outlined the neighboring parts of the city and traced the way
            from a circularly represented place outside our previous route--a place we identified
            as a great cylindrical tower in the carvings and as a vast circular gulf glimpsed
            in our aerial survey--to the present five-pointed structure and the tunnel mouth therein.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>He might, I repeat, have prepared such sketches; for those before us were quite obviously
            compiled, as our own had been, from late sculptures somewhere in the glacial labyrinth,
            though not from the ones which we had seen and used. But what the art-blind bungler
            could never have done was to execute those sketches in a strange and assured technique
            perhaps superior, despite haste and carelessness, to any of the decadent carvings
            from which they were taken--the characteristic and unmistakable technique of the Old Ones themselves in the dead city's heyday.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>There are those who will say Danforth and I were utterly mad not to flee for our lives after that; since our conclusions
            were now--notwithstanding their wildness--completely fixed, and of a nature I need
            not even mention to those who have read my account as far as this. Perhaps we were
            mad--for have I not said those horrible peaks were mountains of madness? But I think
            I can detect something of the same spirit--albeit in a less extreme form--in the men

            with terror though we were, there was nevertheless fanned within us a blazing flame
            of awe and curiosity which triumphed in the end.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>Of course we did not mean to face that--or those--which we knew had been there, but
            we felt that they must be gone by now. They would by this time have found the other

            too, was blocked, they would have gone on to the north seeking another. They were,
            we remembered, partly independent of light.

         <p>Looking back to that moment, I can scarcely recall just what precise form our new
            emotions took--just what change of immediate objective it was that so sharpened our
            sense of expectancy. We certainly did not mean to face what we feared--yet I will
            not deny that we may have had a lurking, unconscious wish to spy certain things from
            some hidden vantage point. Probably we had not given up our zeal to glimpse the <span title="gothic" class="anchor">abyss</span><span class="note">Definition: a bottomless gulf or pit; any unfathomable (or apparently unfathomable) cavity or

            even in these hasty diagrams, made us think that its subglacial levels must still
            form a feature of peculiar importance. Perhaps it embodied architectural marvels as
            yet unencountered by us. It was certainly of incredible age according to the sculptures
            in which it figured--being indeed among the first things built in the city. Its carvings,
            if preserved, could not but be highly significant. Moreover, it might form a good
            present link with the upper world--a shorter route than the one we were so carefully
            blazing, and probably that by which those others had descended.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>At any rate, the thing we did was to study the terrible sketches--which quite perfectly
            confirmed our own--and start back over the indicated course to the circular place;

               Number Of Synsets: 2</span> would lie beyond that. I need not speak of our journey--during which we continued
            to leave an economical trail of paper--for it was precisely the same in kind as that
            by which we had reached the cul-de-sac; except that it tended to adhere more closely
            to the ground level and even descend to basement corridors. Every now and then we
            could trace certain disturbing marks in the debris or litter underfoot; and after
            we had passed outside the radius of the gasoline scent, we were again faintly conscious--spasmodically--of
            that more hideous and more persistent scent. After the way had branched from our former
            course, we sometimes gave the rays of our single torch a furtive sweep along the walls;
            noting in almost every case the well-nigh omnipresent sculptures, which indeed seem
            to have formed a main aesthetic outlet for the Old Ones.

            up to a height of fully sixty feet. This, we recalled from our aerial survey, meant
            an outside glaciation of some forty feet; since the yawning gulf we had seen from
            the plane had been at the top of an approximately twenty-foot mound of crumbled masonry,
            somewhat sheltered for three-fourths of its circumference by the massive curving walls
            of a line of higher ruins. According to the sculptures, the original tower had stood
            in the center of an immense circular plaza, and had been perhaps five hundred or six
            hundred feet high, with tiers of horizontal disks near the top, and a row of needlelike
            spires along the upper rim. Most of the masonry had obviously toppled outward rather
            than inward--a fortunate happening, since otherwise the ramp might have been shattered
            and the whole interior choked. As it was, the ramp showed sad battering; whilst the
            choking was such that all the archways at the bottom seemed to have been recently
            cleared.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>It took us only a moment to conclude that this was indeed the route by which those
            others had descended, and that this would be the logical route for our own ascent
            despite the long trail of paper we had left elsewhere. The tower's mouth was no farther
            from the foothills and our waiting plane than was the great terraced building we had
            entered, and any further subglacial exploration we might make on this trip would lie
            in this general region. Oddly, we were still thinking about possible later trips--even
            after all we had seen and guessed. Then, as we picked our way cautiously over the
            debris of the great floor, there came a sight which for the time excluded all other
            matters.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>It was the neatly huddled array of three sledges in that farther angle of the ramp's
            lower and outward-projecting course which had hitherto been screened from our view.
            There they were--the three sledges missing from Lake's camp--shaken by a hard usage which must have included forcible dragging along great
            reaches of snowless masonry and debris, as well as much hand portage over utterly
            unnavigable places. They were carefully and intelligently packed and strapped, and
            contained things memorably familiar enough: the gasoline stove, fuel cans, instrument
            cases, provision tins, tarpaulins obviously bulging with books, and some bulging with
            less obvious contents--everything derived from Lake's equipment.

         <p>After what we had found in that other room, we were in a measure prepared for this
            encounter. The really great shock came when we stepped over and undid one tarpaulin
            whose outlines had peculiarly disquieted us. It seems that others as well as Lake had been interested in collecting typical specimens; for there were two here, both
            stiffly frozen, perfectly preserved, patched with adhesive plaster where some wounds
            around the neck had occurred, and wrapped with care to prevent further damage. They
            were the bodies of young Gedney and the missing dog.

            was simply the raucous squawking of a penguin.

            was one of age-long and uniform lifelessness--could lead to only one conclusion; hence
            our first thought was to verify the objective reality of the sound. It was, indeed,
            repeated, and seemed at times to come from more than one throat. Seeking its source,
            we entered an archway from which much debris had been cleared; resuming our trail
            blazing--with an added paper supply taken with curious repugnance from one of the
            tarpaulin bundles on the sledges--when we left daylight behind.

         <p>As the glaciated floor gave place to a litter of detritus, we plainly discerned some
            curious, dragging tracks; and once Danforth found a distinct print of a sort whose description would be only too superfluous.
            The course indicated by the penguin cries was precisely what our map and compass prescribed
            as an approach to the more northerly tunnel mouth, and we were glad to find that a
            bridgeless thoroughfare on the ground and basement levels seemed open. The tunnel,
            according to the chart, ought to start from the basement of a large pyramidal structure
            which we seemed vaguely to recall from our aerial survey as remarkably well-preserved.

         <p>Not long afterward a steep descent in a long, low, doorless, and peculiarly sculptureless
            corridor led us to believe that we were approaching the tunnel mouth at last. We had
            passed two more penguins, and heard others immediately ahead. Then the corridor ended
            in a prodigious open space which made us gasp involuntarily--a perfect inverted hemisphere,
            obviously deep underground; fully a hundred feet in diameter and fifty feet high,
            with low archways opening around all parts of the circumference but one, and that
            one yawning cavernously with a black, arched aperture which broke the symmetry of

            vapor proceeded; and we wondered what living entities other than penguins the limitless
            void below, and the contiguous honeycombings of the land and the titan mountains,
            might conceal. We wondered, too, whether the trace of mountaintop smoke at first suspected
            by poor Lake, as well as the odd haze we had ourselves perceived around the rampart-crowned peak,
            might not be caused by the tortuous-channeled rising of some such vapor from the unfathomed
            regions of earth's core.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>Entering the tunnel, we saw that its outline was--at least at the start--about fifteen
            feet each way--sides, floor, and arched roof composed of the usual megalithic masonry.
            The sides were sparsely decorated with <span title="scientific" class="anchor">cartouches</span><span class="note">Definition: a cartridge (usually with paper casing); a cartridge (usually with paper casing)<br />

            were marvelously well-preserved. The floor was quite clear, except for a slight detritus
            bearing outgoing penguin tracks and the inward tracks of these others. The farther
            one advanced, the warmer it became; so that we were soon unbuttoning our heavy garments.
            We wondered whether there were any actually igneous manifestations below, and whether
            the waters of that sunless sea were hot. After a short distance the masonry gave place
            to solid rock, though the tunnel kept the same proportions and presented the same
            aspect of carved regularity. Occasionally its varying grade became so steep that grooves
            were cut in the floor. Several times we noted the mouths of small lateral galleries
            not recorded in our diagrams; none of them such as to complicate the problem of our
            return, and all of them welcome as possible refuges in case we met unwelcome entities

            foolish to venture into that tunnel under the known conditions, but the lure of the
            unplumbed is stronger in certain persons than most suspect--indeed, it was just such

            on the distance we would have to traverse. The carvings had led us to expect a steep
            downhill walk of about a mile to the <span title="gothic" class="anchor">abyss</span><span class="note">Definition: a bottomless gulf or pit; any unfathomable (or apparently unfathomable) cavity or

         <p>After about a quarter of a mile that nameless scent became greatly accentuated, and
            we kept very careful track of the various lateral openings we passed. There was no
            visible vapor as at the mouth, but this was doubtless due to the lack of contrasting
            cooler air. The temperature was rapidly ascending, and we were not surprised to come
            upon a careless heap of material shudderingly familiar to us. It was composed of furs
            and tent cloth taken from Lake's camp, and we did not pause to study the <span title="other" class="anchor">bizarre</span><span class="note">Definition: conspicuously or grossly unconventional or unusual<br />

            of the tunnel for which the carvings had not prepared us--a broadening and rising
            into a lofty, natural-looking elliptical cavern with a level floor, some seventy-five
            feet long and fifty broad, and with many immense side passages leading away into <span title="gothic" class="anchor">cryptical</span><span class="note">Definition: of an obscure nature; having a secret or hidden meaning<br />

         </p>
         
         
         <p>Though this cavern was natural in appearance, an inspection with both torches suggested
            that it had been formed by the artificial destruction of several walls between adjacent
            honeycombings. The walls were rough, and the high, vaulted roof was thick with stalactites;

            of all the great galleries opening off from it; and the singularity of the condition
            was such as to set us vainly puzzling. The curious new fetor which had supplemented

         <p>The regularity of the passage immediately ahead, as well as the larger proportion
            of penguin-droppings there, prevented all confusion as to the right course amidst
            this plethora of equally great cave mouths. Nevertheless we resolved to resume our

            could no longer be expected. Upon resuming our direct progress we cast a beam of torchlight
            over the tunnel walls--and stopped short in amazement at the supremely radical change
            which had come over the carvings in this part of the passage. We realized, of course,
            the great decadence of the Old Ones' sculpture at the time of the tunneling, and had indeed noticed the inferior workmanship

            was a sudden difference wholly transcending explanation--a difference in basic nature
            as well as in mere quality, and involving so profound and calamitous a degradation
            of skill that nothing in the hitherto observed rate of decline could have led one

         <p>Since we could not afford to spend any considerable time in study, we resumed our
            advance after a cursory look; though frequently casting beams over the walls to see
            if any further decorative changes developed. Nothing of the sort was perceived, though
            the carvings were in places rather sparse because of the numerous mouths of smooth-floored
            lateral tunnels. We saw and heard fewer penguins, but thought we caught a vague suspicion
            of an infinitely distant chorus of them somewhere deep within the earth. The new and
            inexplicable odor was abominably strong, and we could detect scarcely a sign of that
            other nameless scent. Puffs of visible vapor ahead bespoke increasing contrasts in

         <p>Still another time have I come to a place where it is very difficult to proceed. I
            ought to be hardened by this stage; but there are some experiences and intimations
            which scar too deeply to permit of healing, and leave only such an added sensitiveness
            that memory reinspires all the original horror. We saw, as I have said, certain obstructions

            simultaneously by a very curious intensification of the strange prevailing fetor,
            now quite plainly mixed with the nameless stench of those others which had gone before.
            The light of the second torch left no doubt of what the obstructions were, and we
            dared approach them only because we could see, even from a distance, that they were

         <p>Penguins, attacked in a body, retaliate savagely with their beaks, and our ears now
            made certain the existence of a rookery far beyond. Had those others disturbed such
            a place and aroused murderous pursuit? The obstructions did not suggest it, for penguins'
            beaks against the tough tissues Lake had dissected could hardly account for the terrible damage our approaching glance
            was beginning to make out. Besides, the huge blind birds we had seen appeared to be
            singularly peaceful.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>Had there, then, been a struggle among those others, and were the absent four responsible?
            If so, where were they? Were they close at hand and likely to form an immediate menace
            to us? We glanced anxiously at some of the smooth-floored lateral passages as we continued

         <p>The new sound, as I have intimated, upset much that we had decided; because it was
            what poor Lake's dissection had led us to attribute to those we had judged dead. It was, Danforth later told me, precisely what he had caught in infinitely muffled form when at that
            spot beyond the alley corner above the glacial level; and it certainly had a shocking
            resemblance to the wind pipings we had both heard around the lofty mountain caves.

         <p>We were in full flight before three notes or syllables had been uttered, though we
            knew that the swiftness of the Old Ones would enable any scream-roused and pursuing survivor of the slaughter to overtake
            us in a moment if it really wished to do so. We had a vague hope, however, that nonaggressive
            conduct and a display of kindred reason might cause such a being to spare us in case
            of capture, if only from scientific curiosity. After all, if such an one had nothing
            to fear for itself, it would have no motive in harming us. Concealment being futile
            at this juncture, we used our torch for a running glance behind, and perceived that
            the mist was thinning. Would we see, at last, a complete and living specimen of those
            others? Again came that insidious musical piping--"Tekeli-li! Tekeli-li!" Then, noting that we were actually gaining on our pursuer, it occurred to us that

            obviously approaching in answer to Danforth's scream, rather than in flight from any other entity. The timing was too close to

         <p>Our exact motive in looking back again was perhaps no more than the immemorial instinct

               Word Type: gothic<br />

            pursuing entity, had not brought us the exchange of stenches which logic called for.
            In the neighborhood of the prostrate things that new and lately unexplainable fetor
            had been wholly dominant; but by this time it ought to have largely given place to
            the nameless stench associated with those others. This it had not done--for instead,
            the newer and less bearable smell was now virtually undiluted, and growing more and
            more poisonously insistent each second.

         <p>So we glanced back simultaneously, it would appear; though no doubt the incipient
            motion of one prompted the imitation of the other. As we did so we flashed both torches
            full strength at the momentarily thinned mist; either from sheer primitive anxiety
            to see all we could, or in a less primitive but equally unconscious effort to dazzle
            the entity before we dimmed our light and dodged among the penguins of the labyrinth
            center ahead. Unhappy act! Not Orpheus himself, or Lot's wife, paid much more dearly
            for a backward glance. And again came that shocking, wide-ranged piping--"Tekeli-li! Tekeli-li!"

         <p>I might as well be frank--even if I cannot bear to be quite direct--in stating what
            we saw; though at the time we felt that it was not to be admitted even to each other.
            The words reaching the reader can never even suggest the awfulness of the sight itself.
            It crippled our consciousness so completely that I wonder we had the residual sense
            to dim our torches as planned, and to strike the right tunnel toward the dead city.
            Instinct alone must have carried us through--perhaps better than reason could have
            done; though if that was what saved us, we paid a high price. Of reason we certainly
            had little enough left.

            Danforth was totally unstrung, and the first thing I remember of the rest of the journey was
            hearing him lightheadedly chant an hysterical formula in which I alone of mankind
            could have found anything but insane irrelevance. It reverberated in falsetto echoes
            among the squawks of the penguins; reverberated through the vaultings ahead, and--thank
            God--through the now empty vaultings behind. He could not have begun it at once--else
            we would not have been alive and blindly racing. I shudder to think of what a shade
            of difference in his nervous reactions might have brought.

            to test the wind for our crossing through the pass. At a very high level there must
            have been great disturbance, since the ice-dust clouds of the zenith were doing all
            sorts of fantastic things; but at twenty-four thousand feet, the height we needed
            for the pass, we found navigation quite practicable. As we drew close to the jutting
            peaks the wind's strange piping again became manifest, and I could see Danforth's hands trembling at the controls. Rank amateur that I was, I thought at that moment
            that I might be a better navigator than he in effecting the dangerous crossing between
            pinnacles; and when I made motions to change seats and take over his duties he did
            not protest. I tried to keep all my skill and self-possession about me, and stared
            at the sector of reddish farther sky betwixt the walls of the pass--resolutely refusing
            to pay attention to the puffs of mountain-top vapor, and wishing that I had wax-stopped
            ears like Ulysses' men off the Siren's coast to keep that disturbing windpiping from my consciousness.

         <p>But Danforth, released from his piloting and keyed up to a dangerous nervous pitch, could not
            keep quiet. I felt him turning and wriggling about as he looked back at the terrible
            receding city, ahead at the cave-riddled, cube-barnacled peaks, sidewise at the bleak
            sea of snowy, rampart-strewn foothills, and upward at the seething, <span title="gothic" class="anchor">grotesquely</span><span class="note">Definition: in a grotesque manner<br />

            that his mad shrieking brought us so close to disaster by shattering my tight hold
            on myself and causing me to fumble helplessly with the controls for a moment. A second
            afterward my resolution triumphed and we made the crossing safely--yet I am afraid
            that Danforth will never be the same again.

         <p>I have said that Danforth refused to tell me what final horror made him scream out so insanely--a horror which,
            I feel sadly sure, is mainly responsible for his present breakdown. We had snatches
            of shouted conversation above the wind's piping and the engine's buzzing as we reached
            the safe side of the range and swooped slowly down toward the camp, but that had mostly
            to do with the pledges of secrecy we had made as we prepared to leave the nightmare
            city. Certain things, we had agreed, were not for people to know and discuss lightly--and
            I would not speak of them now but for the need of heading off that Starkweather-Moore Expedition, and others, at any cost. It is absolutely necessary, for the peace and safety of
            mankind, that some of earth's dark, dead corners and unplumbed depths be let alone;

         <p>All that Danforth has ever hinted is that the final horror was a mirage. It was not, he declares, anything
            connected with the cubes and caves of those echoing, vaporous, wormily-honeycombed
            mountains of madness which we crossed; but a single fantastic, <span title="religious" class="anchor">demoniac</span><span class="note">Definition: someone who acts as if possessed by a demon; frenzied as if possessed by a demon<br />

            westward mountains which the Old Ones had shunned and feared. It is very probable that the thing was a sheer delusion born
            of the previous stresses we had passed through, and of the actual though unrecognized
            mirage of the dead transmontane city experienced near Lake's camp the day before; but it was so real to Danforth that he suffers from it still.

            to his curious and macabre reading of earlier years. Danforth, indeed, is known to be among the few who have ever dared go completely through that
            worm-riddled copy of the Necronomicon kept under lock and key in the college library.

         <p>The higher sky, as we crossed the range, was surely vaporous and disturbed enough;
            and although I did not see the zenith, I can well imagine that its swirls of ice dust
            may have taken strange forms. Imagination, knowing how vividly distant scenes can
            sometimes be reflected, refracted, and magnified by such layers of restless cloud,
            might easily have supplied the rest--and, of course, Danforth did not hint any of these specific horrors till after his memory had had a chance
