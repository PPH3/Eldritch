                <h2><a class="dividerHeading2" href="ATMOM.html">At the Mountains of
                    Madness</a></h2>
                <p class="texts_desc"> An antecedent of our contemporary, highly-speculative ancient
                    astronaut craze, this story perhaps best exemplifies Lovecraft’s worldview. The
                    author wasn’t confined to dusty mansions with replete with vengeful spirits and
                    family curses. The cosmos, for Lovecraft was the unfathomable void from which
                    the most pure horrors emanated from. Many of his tales serve as a warning to
                    those who uncover arcane knowledge or seek to continue forbidden research. For
                    the characters in this work, the arctic yields evidence of extraterrestrial
                    dread, that would confirm the idle speculation of many a modern pseudo
                    archaeologist. </p>

                <h2><a class="dividerHeading2" href="TSOI.html">The Shadow over InnsMouth</a></h2>
                <p class="texts_desc"> Lovecraft’s observation of the deterioration of New England
                    is manifested in this yarn of aquatic resurrections and anthropomorphic
                    amphibious monstrosities. The writer had a decidedly antiquarian lean, and
                    combining that with his raucous xenophobia resulted in one of his finest moments
                    as a scribe of the weird. Acolytes who worship in the elder god cults often
                    exhibit hideous mutations; alterations which are highly sought among Dagon’s
                    priests, and they celebrate their abominable endowments in the ruins of puritan
                    America. </p>

                <h2>
                    <a class="dividerHeading2" href="TCOC.html">The Call of Cthulhu</a></h2>
                <p class="texts_desc"> Being influenced by the apocalyptic romanticism of Lord
                    Alford Tennyson’s The Kraken, The Call of Cthulhu is point of origin for the
                    Cthulhu mythos. Lovecraft’s writing process was one of attrition and refinement.
                    His earlier tale, Dagon, showcases the primordial components that were fleshed
                    out to a more sophisticated result. All of the classic tropes of Providence’s
                    favorite weird raconteur are here in all of their tentacular glory: strange
                    letters of an agitated scholar discovered by a curious relative, fanatical cults
                    writhing in an end-times frenzy, and of course, the titular old one; surfacing
                    from beneath the vast chasm of time and space. </p>
