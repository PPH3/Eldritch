                        >Wikipedia</a>:<br /> “At the Mountains of Madness is a novella by horror
                    writer H. P. Lovecraft, written in February/March 1931 and rejected that year by
                    Weird Tales editor Farnsworth Wright on the grounds of its length. It was
                    originally serialized in the February, March, and April 1936 issues of
                    Astounding Stories. It has been reproduced in numerous collections. The story
                    details the events of a disastrous expedition to the Antarctic continent in
                    September 1930, and what was found there by a group of explorers led by the
                    narrator, Dr. William Dyer of Miskatonic University. Throughout the story, Dyer
                    details a series of previously untold events in the hope of deterring another
                    group of explorers who wish to return to the continent. The novella's title is
                    derived from a line in 'The Hashish Man,' a short story by fantasy writer Edward
                    Plunkett, Lord Dunsany: 'And we came at last to those ivory hills that are named
                    the Mountains of Madness...' The story has inadvertently popularized the concept
                    of ancient astronauts, as well as Antarctica's place in the 'ancient astronaut
                    mythology'”. </p>

                    >Wikipedia</a>:<br /> “The Shadow over Innsmouth is a horror novella by H. P.
                    Lovecraft, written in November–December 1931. It forms part of the Cthulhu
                    Mythos, using its motif of a malign undersea civilization. It references several
                    shared elements of the Mythos, including place-names, mythical creatures and
                    invocations. The narrator is a student on an antiquarian tour of New England. He
                    sees a piece of exotic jewelry in a museum, and learns that its source is the
                    nearby decrepit seaport of Innsmouth. He travels to Innsmouth and observes
                    disturbing events and people. It is the only Lovecraft story which was published
                    in book form during his lifetime. According to L Sprague de Camp, Lovecraft
                    distrusted his ability to narrate action, and the story is unusual in that
                    Lovecraft includes in chapter IV a sustained and effective piece of action
                    writing.”.</p>

                    >Wikipedia</a>:<br /> “The Call of Cthulhu is a short story by the American
                    writer H. P. Lovecraft. Written in the summer of 1926, it was first published in
                    the pulp magazine Weird Tales, in February 1928. The narrator, Francis Wayland
                    Thurston, recounts his discovery of notes left behind by his grand-uncle, Brown
                    University linguistic professor George Gammell Angell after his death in the
                    winter of 1926–27. Among the notes is a small bas-relief sculpture of a scaly
                    creature which yields 'simultaneous pictures of an octopus, a dragon, and a
                    human caricature.' The sculptor, a Rhode Island art student named Henry Anthony
                    Wilcox, based the work on delirious dreams of 'great Cyclopean cities of titan
                    blocks and sky-flung monoliths.' Frequent references to Cthulhu and R'lyeh are
                    found in Wilcox's papers. Angell also discovers reports of mass hysteria around
                    the world. More notes discuss a 1908 meeting of an archeological society in
                    which New Orleans police official John Raymond Legrasse asks attendees to
                    identify a statuette of unidentifiable greenish-black stone resembling Wilcox's
                    sculpture. It is then revealed that the previous year, Legrasse and a party of
                    policemen found several murdered women &amp; children being used in a ritual by
                    an all-male cult, in a shunned region of a Louisiana swamp. After killing five
                    of the cultists and arresting 47 others, Legrasse learns that they worship the
                    'Great Old Ones' and await the return of a monstrous being called Cthulhu. The
                    prisoners identify the statuette as 'great Cthulhu.' One of the academics
                    present at the meeting, Princeton professor William Channing Webb, describes a
                    group of 'Esquimaux' with similar beliefs and fetishes. Thurston discovers a
                    1925 article from an Australian newspaper which reports the discovery of a
                    derelict ship, the Emma, of which second mate Gustaf Johansen is the sole
                    survivor. Johansen reports that the Emma was attacked by a heavily armed yacht
                    called the Alert. The crewmen of the Emma killed those aboard the Alert, but
                    lost their own ship in the battle; commandeered the Alert; and discovered an
                    uncharted island in the vicinity of co-ordinates of 47°9′S 126°43′W. With the
                    exception of Johansen and another man, the remaining crew died on the island;
                    and Johansen does not reveal the manner of their death. Upon traveling to
                    Australia, Thurston views a statue retrieved from the Alert which is identical
                    to the previous two. In Norway, he learns that Johansen died suddenly after an
                    encounter with 'two Lascar sailors'. Johansen's widow provides Thurston with her
                    late husband's manuscript, wherein the uncharted island is described as being
                    home to a "nightmare corpse-city" called R'lyeh. Johansen's crew struggled to
                    comprehend the non-Euclidean geometry of the city and accidentally release
                    Cthulhu, resulting in their deaths. Johansen and one crew-mate flee aboard the
                    Alert and are pursued by Cthulhu. Johansen rams the yacht into the creature's
                    head. Cthulhu explodes into a green mist, only for his injury to regenerate. The
                    Alert escapes, but Johansen's crewmate goes insane and, shortly afterwards,
                    dies. After finishing the manuscript, Thurston realizes he is now a target of
                    Cthulhu's worshippers.”. </p>
